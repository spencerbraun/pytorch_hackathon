 Gaussian quadrature  A few functions are also provided in order to perform simple Gaussian quadrature over a fixed interval. The first is fixed_quad , which performs fixed-order Gaussian quadrature. The second function is quadrature , which performs Gaussian quadrature of multiple orders until the difference in the integral estimate is beneath some tolerance supplied by the user. These functions both use the module , which can calculate the roots and quadrature weights of a large variety of orthogonal polynomials (the polynomials themselves are available as special functions returning instances of the polynomial class â€” e.g., special.legendre ).
