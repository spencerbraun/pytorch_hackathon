Integration (scipy.integrate)
integrate.html
 General integration ( quad )  The function quad is provided to integrate a function of one variable between two points. The points can be ( ) to indicate infinite limits. For example, suppose you wish to integrate a bessel function along the interval \[I\int_{0}^{4.5}J_{2.5}\left(x\right)\, dx.\] This could be computed using quad : The first argument to quad is a “callable” Python object (i.e., a function, method, or class instance). Notice the use of a lambda- function in this case as the argument. The next two arguments are the limits of integration. The return value is a tuple, with the first element holding the estimated value of the integral and the second element holding an upper bound on the error. Notice, that in this case, the true value of this integral is \[I\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\left(\frac{18}{27}\sqrt{2}\cos\left(4.5\right)-\frac{4}{27}\sqrt{2}\sin\left(4.5\right)+\sqrt{2\pi}\textrm{Si}\left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{\pi}}\right)\right),\] where \[\textrm{Si}\left(x\right)\int_{0}^{x}\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}t^{2}\right)\, dt.\] is the Fresnel sine integral. Note that the numerically-computed integral is within of the exact result — well below the reported error bound. If the function to integrate takes additional parameters, they can be provided in the args argument. Suppose that the following integral shall be calculated: \[I(a,b)\int_{0}^{1} ax^2+b \, dx.\] This integral can be evaluated by using the following code: Infinite inputs are also allowed in quad by using as one of the arguments. For example, suppose that a numerical value for the exponential integral: \[E_{n}\left(x\right)\int_{1}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-xt}}{t^{n}}\, dt.\] is desired (and the fact that this integral can be computed as is forgotten). The functionality of the function special.expn can be replicated by defining a new function based on the routine quad : The function which is integrated can even use the quad argument (though the error bound may underestimate the error due to possible numerical error in the integrand from the use of quad ). The integral in this case is \[I_{n}\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{1}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-xt}}{t^{n}}\, dt\, dx\frac{1}{n}.\] This last example shows that multiple integration can be handled using repeated calls to quad .
