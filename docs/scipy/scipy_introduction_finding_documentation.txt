 Finding Documentation  SciPy and NumPy have documentation versions in both HTML and PDF format available at https://docs.scipy.org/ , that cover nearly all available functionality. However, this documentation is still work-in-progress and some parts may be incomplete or sparse. As we are a volunteer organization and depend on the community for growth, your participation - everything from providing feedback to improving the documentation and code - is welcome and actively encouraged. Python’s documentation strings are used in SciPy for on-line documentation. There are two methods for reading them and getting help. One is Python’s command help in the pydoc module. Entering this command with no arguments (i.e. ) launches an interactive help session that allows searching through the keywords and modules available to all of Python. Secondly, running the command help(obj) with an object as the argument displays that object’s calling signature, and documentation string. The pydoc method of is sophisticated but uses a pager to display the text. Sometimes this can interfere with the terminal within which you are running the interactive session. A numpy/scipy-specific help system is also available under the command . The signature and documentation string for the object passed to the command are printed to standard output (or to a writeable object passed as the third argument). The second keyword argument of defines the maximum width of the line for printing. If a module is passed as the argument to then a list of the functions and classes defined in that module is printed. For example: Another useful command is , which can be used to look at the namespace of a module or package.
