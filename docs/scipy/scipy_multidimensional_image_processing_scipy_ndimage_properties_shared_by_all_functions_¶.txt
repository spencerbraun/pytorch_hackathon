 Properties shared by all functions  All functions share some common properties. Notably, all functions allow the specification of an output array with the output argument. With this argument, you can specify an array that will be changed in-place with the result with the operation. In this case, the result is not returned. Usually, using the output argument is more efficient, since an existing array is used to store the result. The type of arrays returned is dependent on the type of operation, but it is, in most cases, equal to the type of the input. If, however, the output argument is used, the type of the result is equal to the type of the specified output argument. If no output argument is given, it is still possible to specify what the result of the output should be. This is done by simply assigning the desired numpy type object to the output argument. For example:
