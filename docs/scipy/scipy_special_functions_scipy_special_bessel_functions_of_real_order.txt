 Bessel functions of real order( jv , jn_zeros )  Bessel functions are a family of solutions to Besselâ€™s differential equation with real or complex order alpha: \[x^2 \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + x \frac{dy}{dx} + (x^2 - \alpha^2)y  0\] Among other uses, these functions arise in wave propagation problems, such as the vibrational modes of a thin drum head. Here is an example of a circular drum head anchored at the edge:
