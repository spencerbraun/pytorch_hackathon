 Integrating using Samples  If the samples are equally-spaced and the number of samples available is for some integer , then Romberg romb integration can be used to obtain high-precision estimates of the integral using the available samples. Romberg integration uses the trapezoid rule at step-sizes related by a power of two and then performs Richardson extrapolation on these estimates to approximate the integral with a higher degree of accuracy. In case of arbitrary spaced samples, the two functions trapz and simps are available. They are using Newton-Coates formulas of order 1 and 2 respectively to perform integration. The trapezoidal rule approximates the function as a straight line between adjacent points, while Simpson’s rule approximates the function between three adjacent points as a parabola. For an odd number of samples that are equally spaced Simpson’s rule is exact if the function is a polynomial of order 3 or less. If the samples are not equally spaced, then the result is exact only if the function is a polynomial of order 2 or less. This corresponds exactly to \[\int_{1}^{4} x^2 \, dx  21,\] whereas integrating the second function does not correspond to \[\int_{1}^{4} x^3 \, dx  63.75\] because the order of the polynomial in f2 is larger than two.
