Integration (scipy.integrate)

 General multiple integration ( dblquad , tplquad , nquad )  The mechanics for double and triple integration have been wrapped up into the functions dblquad and tplquad . These functions take the function to integrate and four, or six arguments, respectively. The limits of all inner integrals need to be defined as functions. An example of using double integration to compute several values of is shown below: As example for non-constant limits consider the integral \[I\int_{y0}^{1/2}\int_{x0}^{1-2y} x y \, dx\, dy\frac{1}{96}.\] This integral can be evaluated using the expression below (Note the use of the non-constant lambda functions for the upper limit of the inner integral): For n-fold integration, scipy provides the function nquad . The integration bounds are an iterable object: either a list of constant bounds, or a list of functions for the non-constant integration bounds. The order of integration (and therefore the bounds) is from the innermost integral to the outermost one. The integral from above \[I_{n}\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{1}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-xt}}{t^{n}}\, dt\, dx\frac{1}{n}\] can be calculated as Note that the order of arguments for f must match the order of the integration bounds; i.e., the inner integral with respect to is on the interval and the outer integral with respect to is on the interval . Non-constant integration bounds can be treated in a similar manner; the example from above \[I\int_{y0}^{1/2}\int_{x0}^{1-2y} x y \, dx\, dy\frac{1}{96}.\] can be evaluated by means of which is the same result as before.
