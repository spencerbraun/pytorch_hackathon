 11.3 Complications The user should be aware that there are a few things that can happening when subsampling that can cause issues in their code. As previously mentioned, when sampling occurs in relation to pre-processing is one such issue. Others are: Sparsely represented categories in factor variables may turn into zero-variance predictors or may be completely sampled out of the model. The underlying functions that do the sampling (e.g. SMOTE , downSample , etc) operate in very different ways and this can affect your results. For example, SMOTE and ROSE will convert your predictor input argument into a data frame (even if you start with a matrix). Currently, sample weights are not supported with sub-sampling. If you use tuneLength to specify the search grid, understand that the data that is used to determine the grid has not been sampled. In most cases, this will not matter but if the grid creation process is affected by the sample size, you may end up using a sub-optimal tuning grid. For some models that require more samples than parameters, a reduction in the sample size may prevent you from being able to fit the model.
