16 Miscellaneous Model Functions

 16.3 Bagged MARS and FDA Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models, like classification/regression trees, are unstable predictors (Breiman, 1996). This means that small perturbations in the training data might lead to significantly different models. Bagged trees and random forests are effective ways of improving tree models by exploiting these instabilities. caret contains a function, bagEarth , that fits MARS models via the earth function. There are formula and non-formula interfaces. Also, flexible discriminant analysis is a generalization of linear discriminant analysis that can use non-linear features as inputs. One way of doing this is the use MARS-type features to classify samples. The function bagFDA fits FDA models of a set of bootstrap samples and aggregates the predictions to reduce noise. This function is deprecated in favor of the bag function.
