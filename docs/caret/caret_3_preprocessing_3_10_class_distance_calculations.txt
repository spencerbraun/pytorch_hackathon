 3.10 Class Distance Calculations caret contains functions to generate new predictors variables based on distances to class centroids (similar to how linear discriminant analysis works). For each level of a factor variable, the class centroid and covariance matrix is calculated. For new samples, the Mahalanobis distance to each of the class centroids is computed and can be used as an additional predictor. This can be helpful for non-linear models when the true decision boundary is actually linear. In cases where there are more predictors within a class than samples, the classDist function has arguments called pca and keep arguments that allow for principal components analysis within each class to be used to avoid issues with singular covariance matrices. predict.classDist is then used to generate the class distances. By default, the distances are logged, but this can be changed via the trans argument to predict.classDist . As an example, we can used the MDRR data. This image shows a scatterplot matrix of the class distances for the held-out samples:
