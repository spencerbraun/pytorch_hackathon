 13.1 Introduction The package contains a large number of predictive model interfaces. However, you may want to create your own because: you are testing out a novel model or the package doesn’t have a model that you are interested in you would like to run an existing model in the package your own way there are pre-processing or sampling steps not contained in the package or you just don’t like the way the package does things You can still get the benefits of the caret infrastructure by creating your own model. Currently, when you specify the type of model that you are interested in (e.g. type  "lda" ), the train function runs another function called getModelInfo to retrieve the specifics of that model from the existing catalog. For example: To use your own model, you can pass a list of these components to type . This page will describe those components in detail.
