 7.0.22 Linear Regression (back to contents ) Bagged Logic Regression Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: nleaves (Maximum Number of Leaves) ntrees (Number of Trees) Required packages: logicFS Notes: Unlike other packages used by train , the logicFS package is fully loaded when this model is used. Bayesian Ridge Regression Type: Regression No tuning parameters for this model Required packages: monomvn Bayesian Ridge Regression (Model Averaged) Type: Regression No tuning parameters for this model Required packages: monomvn Notes: This model makes predictions by averaging the predictions based on the posterior estimates of the regression coefficients. While it is possible that some of these posterior estimates are zero for non-informative predictors, the final predicted value may be a function of many (or even all) predictors. Boosted Linear Model Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: mstop (# Boosting Iterations) nu (Shrinkage) Required packages: bst , plyr Cubist Type: Regression Tuning parameters: committees (#Committees) neighbors (#Instances) Required packages: Cubist A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Elasticnet Type: Regression Tuning parameters: fraction (Fraction of Full Solution) lambda (Weight Decay) Required packages: elasticnet glmnet Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: alpha (Mixing Percentage) lambda (Regularization Parameter) Required packages: h2o A model-specific variable importance metric is available. glmnet Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: alpha (Mixing Percentage) lambda (Regularization Parameter) Required packages: glmnet , Matrix A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Independent Component Regression Type: Regression Tuning parameters: n.comp (#Components) Required packages: fastICA L2 Regularized Support Vector Machine (dual) with Linear Kernel Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: cost (Cost) Loss (Loss Function) Required packages: LiblineaR Least Angle Regression Type: Regression Tuning parameters: fraction (Fraction) Required packages: lars Least Angle Regression Type: Regression Tuning parameters: step (#Steps) Required packages: lars Linear Regression Type: Regression Tuning parameters: intercept (intercept) A model-specific variable importance metric is available.

Non-Convex Penalized Quantile Regression Type: Regression Tuning parameters: lambda (L1 Penalty) penalty (Penalty Type) Required packages: rqPen Non-Negative Least Squares Type: Regression No tuning parameters for this model Required packages: nnls A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Partial Least Squares Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: ncomp (#Components) Required packages: pls A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Partial Least Squares Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: ncomp (#Components) Required packages: pls A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Partial Least Squares Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: ncomp (#Components) Required packages: pls A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Partial Least Squares Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: ncomp (#Components) Required packages: pls A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Penalized Linear Regression Type: Regression Tuning parameters: lambda1 (L1 Penalty) lambda2 (L2 Penalty) Required packages: penalized Penalized Ordinal Regression Type: Classification Tuning parameters: alpha (Mixing Percentage) criteria (Selection Criterion) link (Link Function) Required packages: ordinalNet , plyr A model-specific variable importance metric is available.

Sparse Partial Least Squares Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: K (#Components) eta (Threshold) kappa (Kappa) Required packages: spls Spike and Slab Regression Type: Regression Tuning parameters: vars (Variables Retained) Required packages: spikeslab , plyr Notes: Unlike other packages used by train , the spikeslab package is fully loaded when this model is used. Supervised Principal Component Analysis Type: Regression Tuning parameters: threshold (Threshold) n.components (#Components) Required packages: superpc Support Vector Machines with Linear Kernel Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: C (Cost) Required packages: kernlab Support Vector Machines with Linear Kernel Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: cost (Cost) Required packages: e1071 The Bayesian lasso Type: Regression Tuning parameters: sparsity (Sparsity Threshold) Required packages: monomvn Notes: This model creates predictions using the mean of the posterior distributions but sets some parameters specifically to zero based on the tuning parameter sparsity . For example, when sparsity  .5 , only coefficients where at least half the posterior estimates are nonzero are used. The lasso Type: Regression Tuning parameters: fraction (Fraction of Full Solution) Required packages: elasticnet
