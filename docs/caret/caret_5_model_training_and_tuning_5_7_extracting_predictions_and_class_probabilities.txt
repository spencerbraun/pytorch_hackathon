5 Model Training and Tuning

 5.7 Extracting Predictions and Class Probabilities As previously mentioned, objects produced by the train function contain the “optimized” model in the finalModel sub-object. Predictions can be made from these objects as usual. In some cases, such as pls or gbm objects, additional parameters from the optimized fit may need to be specified. In these cases, the train objects uses the results of the parameter optimization to predict new samples. For example, if predictions were created using predict.gbm , the user would have to specify the number of trees directly (there is no default). Also, for binary classification, the predictions from this function take the form of the probability of one of the classes, so extra steps are required to convert this to a factor vector. predict.train automatically handles these details for this (and for other models). Also, there are very few standard syntaxes for model predictions in R. For example, to get class probabilities, many predict methods have an argument called type that is used to specify whether the classes or probabilities should be generated. Different packages use different values of type , such as "prob" , "posterior" , "response" , "probability" or "raw" . In other cases, completely different syntax is used. For predict.train , the type options are standardized to be "class" and "prob" (the underlying code matches these to the appropriate choices for each model. For example:
