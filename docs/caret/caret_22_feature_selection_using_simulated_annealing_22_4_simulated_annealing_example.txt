 22.4 Simulated Annealing Example Using the example from the previous page where there are five real predictors and 40 noise predictors. We’ll fit a random forest model and use the out-of-bag RMSE estimate as the internal performance metric and use the same repeated 10-fold cross-validation process used with the search. To do this, we’ll use the built-in rfSA object for this purpose. The default SA operators will be used with 1000 iterations of the algorithm. As with the GA, we can plot the internal and external performance over iterations. The performance here isn’t as good as the previous GA or RFE solutions. Based on these results, the iteration associated with the best external RMSE estimate was 212 with a corresponding RMSE estimate of 3.31. Using the entire training set, the final SA is conducted and, at iteration 212, there were 21 selected: real1, real2, real5, bogus1, bogus3, bogus9, bogus10, bogus13, bogus14, bogus15, bogus19, bogus20, bogus23, bogus24, bogus25, bogus26, bogus28, bogus31, bogus33, bogus38, bogus44. The random forest model with these predictors is created using the entire training set is trained and this is the model that is used when predict.safs is executed.
