 7.0.21 Linear Classifier (back to contents ) Adjacent Categories Probability Model for Ordinal Data Type: Classification Tuning parameters: parallel (Parallel Curves) link (Link Function) Required packages: VGAM Bagged Logic Regression Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: nleaves (Maximum Number of Leaves) ntrees (Number of Trees) Required packages: logicFS Notes: Unlike other packages used by train , the logicFS package is fully loaded when this model is used. Bayesian Generalized Linear Model Type: Regression, Classification No tuning parameters for this model Required packages: arm Boosted Generalized Linear Model Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: mstop (# Boosting Iterations) prune (AIC Prune?) Required packages: plyr , mboost A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Notes: The prune option for this model enables the number of iterations to be determined by the optimal AIC value across all iterations. See the examples in ?mboost::mstop . If pruning is not used, the ensemble makes predictions using the exact value of the mstop tuning parameter value.
