 7.0.15 Generalized Linear Model (back to contents ) Bayesian Generalized Linear Model Type: Regression, Classification No tuning parameters for this model Required packages: arm Boosted Generalized Linear Model Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: mstop (# Boosting Iterations) prune (AIC Prune?) Required packages: plyr , mboost A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Notes: The prune option for this model enables the number of iterations to be determined by the optimal AIC value across all iterations. See the examples in ?mboost::mstop . If pruning is not used, the ensemble makes predictions using the exact value of the mstop tuning parameter value. Ensembles of Generalized Linear Models Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: maxInteractionOrder (Interaction Order) Required packages: randomGLM Notes: Unlike other packages used by train , the randomGLM package is fully loaded when this model is used. Generalized Additive Model using LOESS Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: span (Span) degree (Degree) Required packages: gam A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Notes: Which terms enter the model in a nonlinear manner is determined by the number of unique values for the predictor. For example, if a predictor only has four unique values, most basis expansion method will fail because there are not enough granularity in the data. By default, a predictor must have at least 10 unique values to be used in a nonlinear basis expansion. Unlike other packages used by train , the gam package is fully loaded when this model is used. Generalized Additive Model using Splines Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: select (Feature Selection) method (Method) Required packages: mgcv A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Notes: Which terms enter the model in a nonlinear manner is determined by the number of unique values for the predictor. For example, if a predictor only has four unique values, most basis expansion method will fail because there are not enough granularity in the data. By default, a predictor must have at least 10 unique values to be used in a nonlinear basis expansion. Unlike other packages used by train , the mgcv package is fully loaded when this model is used.

Generalized Additive Model using Splines Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: df (Degrees of Freedom) Required packages: gam A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Notes: Which terms enter the model in a nonlinear manner is determined by the number of unique values for the predictor. For example, if a predictor only has four unique values, most basis expansion method will fail because there are not enough granularity in the data. By default, a predictor must have at least 10 unique values to be used in a nonlinear basis expansion. Unlike other packages used by train , the gam package is fully loaded when this model is used. Generalized Linear Model Type: Regression, Classification No tuning parameters for this model A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Generalized Linear Model with Stepwise Feature Selection Type: Regression, Classification No tuning parameters for this model Required packages: MASS glmnet Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: alpha (Mixing Percentage) lambda (Regularization Parameter) Required packages: h2o A model-specific variable importance metric is available. glmnet Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: alpha (Mixing Percentage) lambda (Regularization Parameter) Required packages: glmnet , Matrix A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Multi-Step Adaptive MCP-Net Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: alphas (Alpha) nsteps (#Adaptive Estimation Steps) scale (Adaptive Weight Scaling Factor) Required packages: msaenet A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Negative Binomial Generalized Linear Model Type: Regression Tuning parameters: link (Link Function) Required packages: MASS A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Penalized Ordinal Regression Type: Classification Tuning parameters: alpha (Mixing Percentage) criteria (Selection Criterion) link (Link Function) Required packages: ordinalNet , plyr A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Notes: Requires ordinalNet package version > 2.0
