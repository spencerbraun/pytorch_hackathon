Partial Least Squares Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: ncomp (#Components) Required packages: pls A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Polynomial Kernel Regularized Least Squares Type: Regression Tuning parameters: lambda (Regularization Parameter) degree (Polynomial Degree) Required packages: KRLS Radial Basis Function Kernel Regularized Least Squares Type: Regression Tuning parameters: lambda (Regularization Parameter) sigma (Sigma) Required packages: KRLS , kernlab Relevance Vector Machines with Linear Kernel Type: Regression No tuning parameters for this model Required packages: kernlab Relevance Vector Machines with Polynomial Kernel Type: Regression Tuning parameters: scale (Scale) degree (Polynomial Degree) Required packages: kernlab Relevance Vector Machines with Radial Basis Function Kernel Type: Regression Tuning parameters: sigma (Sigma) Required packages: kernlab Support Vector Machines with Boundrange String Kernel Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: length (length) C (Cost) Required packages: kernlab Support Vector Machines with Class Weights Type: Classification Tuning parameters: sigma (Sigma) C (Cost) Weight (Weight) Required packages: kernlab Support Vector Machines with Exponential String Kernel Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: lambda (lambda) C (Cost) Required packages: kernlab Support Vector Machines with Linear Kernel Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: C (Cost) Required packages: kernlab Support Vector Machines with Linear Kernel Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: cost (Cost) Required packages: e1071 Support Vector Machines with Polynomial Kernel Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: degree (Polynomial Degree) scale (Scale) C (Cost) Required packages: kernlab Support Vector Machines with Radial Basis Function Kernel Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: sigma (Sigma) C (Cost) Required packages: kernlab Support Vector Machines with Radial Basis Function Kernel Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: C (Cost) Required packages: kernlab Support Vector Machines with Radial Basis Function Kernel Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: sigma (Sigma) C (Cost) Required packages: kernlab Notes: This SVM model tunes over the cost parameter and the RBF kernel parameter sigma. In the latter case, using tuneLength will, at most, evaluate six values of the kernel parameter. This enables a broad search over the cost parameter and a relatively narrow search over sigma Support Vector Machines with Spectrum String Kernel Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: length (length) C (Cost) Required packages: kernlab
