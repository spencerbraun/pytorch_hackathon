CART Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: cp (Complexity Parameter) Required packages: rpart A model-specific variable importance metric is available. CART Type: Regression, Classification No tuning parameters for this model Required packages: rpart A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Notes: This CART model replicates the same process used by the rpart function where the model complexity is determined using the one-standard error method. This procedure is replicated inside of the resampling done by train so that an external resampling estimate can be obtained.
