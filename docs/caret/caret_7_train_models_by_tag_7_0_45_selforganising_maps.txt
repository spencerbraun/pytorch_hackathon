 7.0.45 Self-Organising Maps (back to contents ) Self-Organizing Maps Type: Classification, Regression Tuning parameters: xdim (Rows) ydim (Columns) user.weights (Layer Weight) topo (Topology) Required packages: kohonen Notes: As of version 3.0.0 of the kohonen package, the argument user.weights replaces the old alpha parameter. user.weights is usually a vector of relative weights such as c(1, 3) but is parameterized here as a proportion such as c(1-.75, .75) where the .75 is the value of the tuning parameter passed to train and indicates that the outcome layer has 3 times the weight as the predictor layer.
