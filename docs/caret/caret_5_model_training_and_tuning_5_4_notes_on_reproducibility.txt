5 Model Training and Tuning

 5.4 Notes on Reproducibility Many models utilize random numbers during the phase where parameters are estimated. Also, the resampling indices are chosen using random numbers. There are two main ways to control the randomness in order to assure reproducible results. There are two approaches to ensuring that the same resamples are used between calls to train . The first is to use set.seed just prior to calling train . The first use of random numbers is to create the resampling information. Alternatively, if you would like to use specific splits of the data, the index argument of the trainControl function can be used. This is briefly discussed below. When the models are created inside of resampling , the seeds can also be set. While setting the seed prior to calling train may guarantee that the same random numbers are used, this is unlikely to be the case when parallel processing is used (depending which technology is utilized). To set the model fitting seeds, trainControl has an additional argument called seeds that can be used. The value for this argument is a list of integer vectors that are used as seeds. The help page for trainControl describes the appropriate format for this option. How random numbers are used is highly dependent on the package author. There are rare cases where the underlying model function does not control the random number seed, especially if the computations are conducted in C code. Also, please note that some packages load random numbers when loaded (directly or via namespace) and this may affect reproducibility.
