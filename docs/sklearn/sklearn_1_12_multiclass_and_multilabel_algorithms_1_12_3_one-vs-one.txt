 1.12.3. One-Vs-One  OneVsOneClassifier constructs one classifier per pair of classes. At prediction time, the class which received the most votes is selected. In the event of a tie (among two classes with an equal number of votes), it selects the class with the highest aggregate classification confidence by summing over the pair-wise classification confidence levels computed by the underlying binary classifiers. Since it requires to fit classifiers, this method is usually slower than one-vs-the-rest, due to its O(n_classes^2) complexity. However, this method may be advantageous for algorithms such as kernel algorithms which don’t scale well with . This is because each individual learning problem only involves a small subset of the data whereas, with one-vs-the-rest, the complete dataset is used times. The decision function is the result of a monotonic transformation of the one-versus-one classification. 1.12.3.1.
