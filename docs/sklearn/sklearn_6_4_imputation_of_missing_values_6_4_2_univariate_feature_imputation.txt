 6.4.2. Univariate feature imputation  The SimpleImputer class provides basic strategies for imputing missing values. Missing values can be imputed with a provided constant value, or using the statistics (mean, median or most frequent) of each column in which the missing values are located. This class also allows for different missing values encodings. The following snippet demonstrates how to replace missing values, encoded as , using the mean value of the columns (axis 0) that contain the missing values: The SimpleImputer class also supports sparse matrices: Note that this format is not meant to be used to implicitly store missing values in the matrix because it would densify it at transform time. Missing values encoded by 0 must be used with dense input. The SimpleImputer class also supports categorical data represented as string values or pandas categoricals when using the or strategy:
