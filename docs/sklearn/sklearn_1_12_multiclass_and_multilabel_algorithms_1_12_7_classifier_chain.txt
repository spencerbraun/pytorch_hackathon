 1.12.7. Classifier Chain  Classifier chains (see ClassifierChain ) are a way of combining a number of binary classifiers into a single multi-label model that is capable of exploiting correlations among targets. For a multi-label classification problem with N classes, N binary classifiers are assigned an integer between 0 and N-1. These integers define the order of models in the chain. Each classifier is then fit on the available training data plus the true labels of the classes whose models were assigned a lower number. When predicting, the true labels will not be available. Instead the predictions of each model are passed on to the subsequent models in the chain to be used as features. Clearly the order of the chain is important. The first model in the chain has no information about the other labels while the last model in the chain has features indicating the presence of all of the other labels. In general one does not know the optimal ordering of the models in the chain so typically many randomly ordered chains are fit and their predictions are averaged together.
