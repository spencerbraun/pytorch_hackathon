 6.7.3. Additive Chi Squared Kernel  The additive chi squared kernel is a kernel on histograms, often used in computer vision. The additive chi squared kernel as used here is given by \[k(x, y)  \sum_i \frac{2x_iy_i}{x_i+y_i}\] This is not exactly the same as sklearn.metrics.additive_chi2_kernel . The authors of [VZ2010] prefer the version above as it is always positive definite. Since the kernel is additive, it is possible to treat all components separately for embedding. This makes it possible to sample the Fourier transform in regular intervals, instead of approximating using Monte Carlo sampling. The class AdditiveChi2Sampler implements this component wise deterministic sampling. Each component is sampled times, yielding dimensions per input dimension (the multiple of two stems from the real and complex part of the Fourier transform). In the literature, is usually chosen to be 1 or 2, transforming the dataset to size (in the case of ). The approximate feature map provided by AdditiveChi2Sampler can be combined with the approximate feature map provided by RBFSampler to yield an approximate feature map for the exponentiated chi squared kernel. See the [VZ2010] for details and [VVZ2010] for combination with the RBFSampler .
