 2.2.3. Locally Linear Embedding  Locally linear embedding (LLE) seeks a lower-dimensional projection of the data which preserves distances within local neighborhoods. It can be thought of as a series of local Principal Component Analyses which are globally compared to find the best non-linear embedding. Locally linear embedding can be performed with function locally_linear_embedding or its object-oriented counterpart LocallyLinearEmbedding . 2.2.3.1. Complexity  The standard LLE algorithm comprises three stages: Nearest Neighbors Search . See discussion under Isomap above. Weight Matrix Construction . . The construction of the LLE weight matrix involves the solution of a linear equation for each of the local neighborhoods Partial Eigenvalue Decomposition . See discussion under Isomap above. The overall complexity of standard LLE is . : number of training data points : input dimension : number of nearest neighbors : output dimension References: “Nonlinear dimensionality reduction by locally linear embedding” Roweis, S. & Saul, L.
