 2.7.1. Overview of outlier detection methods  A comparison of the outlier detection algorithms in scikit-learn. Local Outlier Factor (LOF) does not show a decision boundary in black as it has no predict method to be applied on new data when it is used for outlier detection. ensemble.IsolationForest and neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor perform reasonably well on the data sets considered here. The svm.OneClassSVM is known to be sensitive to outliers and thus does not perform very well for outlier detection. Finally, covariance.EllipticEnvelope assumes the data is Gaussian and learns an ellipse. For more details on the different estimators refer to the example Comparing anomaly detection algorithms for outlier detection on toy datasets and the sections hereunder. Examples: See Comparing anomaly detection algorithms for outlier detection on toy datasets for a comparison of the svm.OneClassSVM , the ensemble.IsolationForest , the neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor and covariance.EllipticEnvelope .
