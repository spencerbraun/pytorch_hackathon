 2.8.1. Density Estimation: Histograms  A histogram is a simple visualization of data where bins are defined, and the number of data points within each bin is tallied. An example of a histogram can be seen in the upper-left panel of the following figure: A major problem with histograms, however, is that the choice of binning can have a disproportionate effect on the resulting visualization. Consider the upper-right panel of the above figure. It shows a histogram over the same data, with the bins shifted right. The results of the two visualizations look entirely different, and might lead to different interpretations of the data. Intuitively, one can also think of a histogram as a stack of blocks, one block per point. By stacking the blocks in the appropriate grid space, we recover the histogram. But what if, instead of stacking the blocks on a regular grid, we center each block on the point it represents, and sum the total height at each location? This idea leads to the lower-left visualization. It is perhaps not as clean as a histogram, but the fact that the data drive the block locations mean that it is a much better representation of the underlying data. This visualization is an example of a kernel density estimation , in this case with a top-hat kernel (i.e. a square block at each point). We can recover a smoother distribution by using a smoother kernel. The bottom-right plot shows a Gaussian kernel density estimate, in which each point contributes a Gaussian curve to the total. The result is a smooth density estimate which is derived from the data, and functions as a powerful non-parametric model of the distribution of points.
