 2.4.3. Biclustering evaluation  There are two ways of evaluating a biclustering result: internal and external. Internal measures, such as cluster stability, rely only on the data and the result themselves. Currently there are no internal bicluster measures in scikit-learn. External measures refer to an external source of information, such as the true solution. When working with real data the true solution is usually unknown, but biclustering artificial data may be useful for evaluating algorithms precisely because the true solution is known. To compare a set of found biclusters to the set of true biclusters, two similarity measures are needed: a similarity measure for individual biclusters, and a way to combine these individual similarities into an overall score. To compare individual biclusters, several measures have been used. For now, only the Jaccard index is implemented: \[J(A, B)  \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A| + |B| - |A \cap B|}\] where and are biclusters, is the number of elements in their intersection. The Jaccard index achieves its minimum of 0 when the biclusters to not overlap at all and its maximum of 1 when they are identical. Several methods have been developed to compare two sets of biclusters. For now, only consensus_score (Hochreiter et. al., 2010) is available: Compute bicluster similarities for pairs of biclusters, one in each set, using the Jaccard index or a similar measure. Assign biclusters from one set to another in a one-to-one fashion to maximize the sum of their similarities. This step is performed using the Hungarian algorithm. The final sum of similarities is divided by the size of the larger set. The minimum consensus score, 0, occurs when all pairs of biclusters are totally dissimilar. The maximum score, 1, occurs when both sets are identical. References: Hochreiter, Bodenhofer, et. al., 2010. FABIA: factor analysis for bicluster acquisition .
