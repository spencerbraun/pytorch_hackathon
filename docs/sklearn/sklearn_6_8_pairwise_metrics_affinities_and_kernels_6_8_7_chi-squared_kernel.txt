 6.8.7. Chi-squared kernel  The chi-squared kernel is a very popular choice for training non-linear SVMs in computer vision applications. It can be computed using chi2_kernel and then passed to an sklearn.svm.SVC with : It can also be directly used as the argument: The chi squared kernel is given by \[k(x, y)  \exp \left (-\gamma \sum_i \frac{(x[i] - y[i]) ^ 2}{x[i] + y[i]} \right )\] The data is assumed to be non-negative, and is often normalized to have an L1-norm of one. The normalization is rationalized with the connection to the chi squared distance, which is a distance between discrete probability distributions. The chi squared kernel is most commonly used on histograms (bags) of visual words. References: Zhang, J. and Marszalek, M. and Lazebnik, S. and Schmid, C.
