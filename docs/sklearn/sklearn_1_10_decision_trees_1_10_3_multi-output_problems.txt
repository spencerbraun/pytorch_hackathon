 1.10.3. Multi-output problems  A multi-output problem is a supervised learning problem with several outputs to predict, that is when Y is a 2d array of size . When there is no correlation between the outputs, a very simple way to solve this kind of problem is to build n independent models, i.e. one for each output, and then to use those models to independently predict each one of the n outputs. However, because it is likely that the output values related to the same input are themselves correlated, an often better way is to build a single model capable of predicting simultaneously all n outputs. First, it requires lower training time since only a single estimator is built. Second, the generalization accuracy of the resulting estimator may often be increased. With regard to decision trees, this strategy can readily be used to support multi-output problems. This requires the following changes: Store n output values in leaves, instead of 1; Use splitting criteria that compute the average reduction across all n outputs. This module offers support for multi-output problems by implementing this strategy in both DecisionTreeClassifier and DecisionTreeRegressor . If a decision tree is fit on an output array Y of size then the resulting estimator will: Output n_output values upon ; Output a list of n_output arrays of class probabilities upon . The use of multi-output trees for regression is demonstrated in Multi-output Decision Tree Regression . In this example, the input X is a single real value and the outputs Y are the sine and cosine of X. The use of multi-output trees for classification is demonstrated in Face completion with a multi-output estimators . In this example, the inputs X are the pixels of the upper half of faces and the outputs Y are the pixels of the lower half of those faces.
