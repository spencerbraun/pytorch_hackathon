 1.2.1. Dimensionality reduction using Linear Discriminant Analysis  LinearDiscriminantAnalysis can be used to perform supervised dimensionality reduction, by projecting the input data to a linear subspace consisting of the directions which maximize the separation between classes (in a precise sense discussed in the mathematics section below). The dimension of the output is necessarily less than the number of classes, so this is in general a rather strong dimensionality reduction, and only makes sense in a multiclass setting. This is implemented in the method. The desired dimensionality can be set using the parameter. This parameter has no influence on the and methods.
