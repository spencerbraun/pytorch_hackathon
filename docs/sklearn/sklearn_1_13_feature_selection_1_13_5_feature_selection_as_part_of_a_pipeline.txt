 1.13.5. Feature selection as part of a pipeline  Feature selection is usually used as a pre-processing step before doing the actual learning. The recommended way to do this in scikit-learn is to use a sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline : In this snippet we make use of a sklearn.svm.LinearSVC coupled with sklearn.feature_selection.SelectFromModel to evaluate feature importances and select the most relevant features. Then, a sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier is trained on the transformed output, i.e. using only relevant features. You can perform similar operations with the other feature selection methods and also classifiers that provide a way to evaluate feature importances of course. See the sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline examples for more details.
