 1.6.1. Unsupervised Nearest Neighbors  NearestNeighbors implements unsupervised nearest neighbors learning. It acts as a uniform interface to three different nearest neighbors algorithms: BallTree , KDTree , and a brute-force algorithm based on routines in sklearn.metrics.pairwise . The choice of neighbors search algorithm is controlled through the keyword , which must be one of . When the default value is passed, the algorithm attempts to determine the best approach from the training data. For a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each option, see Nearest Neighbor Algorithms . Warning Regarding the Nearest Neighbors algorithms, if two neighbors and have identical distances but different labels, the result will depend on the ordering of the training data. 1.6.1.1. Finding the Nearest Neighbors  For the simple task of finding the nearest neighbors between two sets of data, the unsupervised algorithms within sklearn.neighbors can be used: Because the query set matches the training set, the nearest neighbor of each point is the point itself, at a distance of zero. It is also possible to efficiently produce a sparse graph showing the connections between neighboring points: The dataset is structured such that points nearby in index order are nearby in parameter space, leading to an approximately block-diagonal matrix of K-nearest neighbors. Such a sparse graph is useful in a variety of circumstances which make use of spatial relationships between points for unsupervised learning: in particular, see sklearn.manifold.Isomap , sklearn.manifold.LocallyLinearEmbedding , and sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering . 1.6.1.2. KDTree and BallTree Classes  Alternatively, one can use the KDTree or BallTree classes directly to find nearest neighbors. This is the functionality wrapped by the NearestNeighbors class used above. The Ball Tree and KD Tree have the same interface; weâ€™ll show an example of using the KD Tree here: Refer to the KDTree and BallTree class documentation for more information on the options available for nearest neighbors searches, including specification of query strategies, distance metrics, etc. For a list of available metrics, see the documentation of the DistanceMetric class.
