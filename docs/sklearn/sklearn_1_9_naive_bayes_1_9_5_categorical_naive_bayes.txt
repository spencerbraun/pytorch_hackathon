 1.9.5. Categorical Naive Bayes  CategoricalNB implements the categorical naive Bayes algorithm for categorically distributed data. It assumes that each feature, which is described by the index , has its own categorical distribution. For each feature in the training set , CategoricalNB estimates a categorical distribution for each feature i of X conditioned on the class y. The index set of the samples is defined as , with as the number of samples. The probability of category in feature given class is estimated as: \[P(x_i  t \mid y  c \: ;\, \alpha)  \frac{ N_{tic} + \alpha}{N_{c} + \alpha n_i},\] where is the number of times category appears in the samples , which belong to class , is the number of samples with class c, is a smoothing parameter and is the number of available categories of feature . CategoricalNB assumes that the sample matrix is encoded (for instance with the help of OrdinalEncoder ) such that all categories for each feature are represented with numbers where is the number of available categories of feature .
