 7.1. General dataset API  There are three main kinds of dataset interfaces that can be used to get datasets depending on the desired type of dataset. The dataset loaders. They can be used to load small standard datasets, described in the Toy datasets section. The dataset fetchers. They can be used to download and load larger datasets, described in the Real world datasets section. Both loaders and fetchers functions return a sklearn.utils.Bunch object holding at least two items: an array of shape * with key (except for 20newsgroups) and a numpy array of length , containing the target values, with key . The Bunch object is a dictionary that exposes its keys are attributes. For more information about Bunch object, see sklearn.utils.Bunch : Itâ€™s also possible for almost all of these function to constrain the output to be a tuple containing only the data and the target, by setting the parameter to . The datasets also contain a full description in their attribute and some contain and . See the dataset descriptions below for details. The dataset generation functions. They can be used to generate controlled synthetic datasets, described in the Generated datasets section. These functions return a tuple consisting of a * numpy array and an array of length containing the targets . In addition, there are also miscellaneous tools to load datasets of other formats or from other locations, described in the Loading other datasets section.
