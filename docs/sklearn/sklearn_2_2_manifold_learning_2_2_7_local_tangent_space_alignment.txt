 2.2.7. Local Tangent Space Alignment  Though not technically a variant of LLE, Local tangent space alignment (LTSA) is algorithmically similar enough to LLE that it can be put in this category. Rather than focusing on preserving neighborhood distances as in LLE, LTSA seeks to characterize the local geometry at each neighborhood via its tangent space, and performs a global optimization to align these local tangent spaces to learn the embedding. LTSA can be performed with function locally_linear_embedding or its object-oriented counterpart LocallyLinearEmbedding , with the keyword . 2.2.7.1. Complexity  The LTSA algorithm comprises three stages: Nearest Neighbors Search . Same as standard LLE Weight Matrix Construction . Approximately . The first term reflects a similar cost to that of standard LLE. Partial Eigenvalue Decomposition . Same as standard LLE The overall complexity of standard LTSA is . : number of training data points : input dimension : number of nearest neighbors : output dimension References: “Principal manifolds and nonlinear dimensionality reduction via tangent space alignment” Zhang, Z. & Zha, H.
