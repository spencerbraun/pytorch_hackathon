 2.6.1. Empirical covariance  The covariance matrix of a data set is known to be well approximated by the classical maximum likelihood estimator (or “empirical covariance”), provided the number of observations is large enough compared to the number of features (the variables describing the observations). More precisely, the Maximum Likelihood Estimator of a sample is an unbiased estimator of the corresponding population’s covariance matrix. The empirical covariance matrix of a sample can be computed using the empirical_covariance function of the package, or by fitting an EmpiricalCovariance object to the data sample with the EmpiricalCovariance.fit method. Be careful that results depend on whether the data are centered, so one may want to use the parameter accurately. More precisely, if , then the test set is supposed to have the same mean vector as the training set. If not, both should be centered by the user, and should be used. Examples: See Shrinkage covariance estimation: LedoitWolf vs OAS and max-likelihood for an example on how to fit an EmpiricalCovariance object to data.
