 1.1.9. Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)  OrthogonalMatchingPursuit and orthogonal_mp implements the OMP algorithm for approximating the fit of a linear model with constraints imposed on the number of non-zero coefficients (ie. the pseudo-norm). Being a forward feature selection method like Least Angle Regression , orthogonal matching pursuit can approximate the optimum solution vector with a fixed number of non-zero elements: \[\underset{w}{\operatorname{arg\,min\,}} ||y - Xw||_2^2 \text{ subject to } ||w||_0 \leq n_{\text{nonzero\_coefs}}\] Alternatively, orthogonal matching pursuit can target a specific error instead of a specific number of non-zero coefficients. This can be expressed as: \[\underset{w}{\operatorname{arg\,min\,}} ||w||_0 \text{ subject to } ||y-Xw||_2^2 \leq \text{tol}\] OMP is based on a greedy algorithm that includes at each step the atom most highly correlated with the current residual. It is similar to the simpler matching pursuit (MP) method, but better in that at each iteration, the residual is recomputed using an orthogonal projection on the space of the previously chosen dictionary elements.
