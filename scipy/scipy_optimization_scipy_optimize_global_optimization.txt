Optimization (scipy.optimize)

 Global optimization  Global optimization aims to find the global minimum of a function within given bounds, in the presence of potentially many local minima. Typically, global minimizers efficiently search the parameter space, while using a local minimizer (e.g., minimize ) under the hood. SciPy contains a number of good global optimizers. Here, we’ll use those on the same objective function, namely the (aptly named) function: This function looks like an egg carton: We now use the global optimizers to obtain the minimum and the function value at the minimum. We’ll store the results in a dictionary so we can compare different optimization results later. All optimizers return an , which in addition to the solution contains information on the number of function evaluations, whether the optimization was successful, and more. For brevity, we won’t show the full output of the other optimizers: shgo has a second method, which returns all local minima rather than only what it thinks is the global minimum: We’ll now plot all found minima on a heatmap of the function:
