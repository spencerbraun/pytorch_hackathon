Interpolation (scipy.interpolate)
interpolate.html
 1-D interpolation ( interp1d )  The interp1d class in scipy.interpolate is a convenient method to create a function based on fixed data points, which can be evaluated anywhere within the domain defined by the given data using linear interpolation. An instance of this class is created by passing the 1-D vectors comprising the data. The instance of this class defines a __call__ method and can therefore by treated like a function which interpolates between known data values to obtain unknown values (it also has a docstring for help). Behavior at the boundary can be specified at instantiation time. The following example demonstrates its use, for linear and cubic spline interpolation: Another set of interpolations in interp1d is nearest , previous , and next , where they return the nearest, previous, or next point along the x-axis. Nearest and next can be thought of as a special case of a causal interpolating filter. The following example demonstrates their use, using the same data as in the previous example:
