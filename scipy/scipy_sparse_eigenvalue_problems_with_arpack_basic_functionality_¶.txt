Sparse eigenvalue problems with ARPACK
arpack.html
 Basic functionality  ARPACK can solve either standard eigenvalue problems of the form \[A \mathbf{x}  \lambda \mathbf{x}\] or general eigenvalue problems of the form \[A \mathbf{x}  \lambda M \mathbf{x}.\] The power of ARPACK is that it can compute only a specified subset of eigenvalue/eigenvector pairs. This is accomplished through the keyword . The following values of are available: : Eigenvalues with largest magnitude ( , ), that is, largest eigenvalues in the euclidean norm of complex numbers. : Eigenvalues with smallest magnitude ( , ), that is, smallest eigenvalues in the euclidean norm of complex numbers. : Eigenvalues with largest real part ( ). : Eigenvalues with smallest real part ( ). : Eigenvalues with largest imaginary part ( ). : Eigenvalues with smallest imaginary part ( ). : Eigenvalues with largest algebraic value ( ), that is, largest eigenvalues inclusive of any negative sign. : Eigenvalues with smallest algebraic value ( ), that is, smallest eigenvalues inclusive of any negative sign. : Eigenvalues from both ends of the spectrum ( ). Note that ARPACK is generally better at finding extremal eigenvalues, that is, eigenvalues with large magnitudes. In particular, using may lead to slow execution time and/or anomalous results. A better approach is to use shift-invert mode .
