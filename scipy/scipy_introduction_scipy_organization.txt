 SciPy Organization  SciPy is organized into subpackages covering different scientific computing domains. These are summarized in the following table: Subpackage Description cluster Clustering algorithms constants Physical and mathematical constants fftpack Fast Fourier Transform routines integrate Integration and ordinary differential equation solvers interpolate Interpolation and smoothing splines io Input and Output linalg Linear algebra ndimage N-dimensional image processing odr Orthogonal distance regression optimize Optimization and root-finding routines signal Signal processing sparse Sparse matrices and associated routines spatial Spatial data structures and algorithms special Special functions stats Statistical distributions and functions SciPy sub-packages need to be imported separately, for example: Because of their ubiquitousness, some of the functions in these subpackages are also made available in the scipy namespace to ease their use in interactive sessions and programs. In addition, many basic array functions from numpy are also available at the top-level of the scipy package. Before looking at the sub-packages individually, we will first look at some of these common functions.
