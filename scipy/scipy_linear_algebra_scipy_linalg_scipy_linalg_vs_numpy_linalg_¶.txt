Linear Algebra (scipy.linalg)

 scipy.linalg vs numpy.linalg  scipy.linalg contains all the functions in numpy.linalg . plus some other more advanced ones not contained in . Another advantage of using over is that it is always compiled with BLAS/LAPACK support, while for numpy this is optional. Therefore, the scipy version might be faster depending on how numpy was installed. Therefore, unless you donâ€™t want to add as a dependency to your program, use instead of .
