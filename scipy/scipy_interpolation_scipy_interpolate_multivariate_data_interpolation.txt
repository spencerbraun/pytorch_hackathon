Interpolation (scipy.interpolate)
interpolate.html
 Multivariate data interpolation ( griddata )  Suppose you have multidimensional data, for instance, for an underlying function f(x, y) you only know the values at points (x[i], y[i]) that do not form a regular grid. Suppose we want to interpolate the 2-D function on a grid in [0, 1]x[0, 1] but we only know its values at 1000 data points: This can be done with griddata â€“ below, we try out all of the interpolation methods: One can see that the exact result is reproduced by all of the methods to some degree, but for this smooth function the piecewise cubic interpolant gives the best results:
