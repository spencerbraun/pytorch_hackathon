 17.3 Measures for Class Probabilities For data with two classes, there are specialized functions for measuring model performance. First, the twoClassSummary function computes the area under the ROC curve and the specificity and sensitivity under the 50% cutoff. Note that: this function uses the first class level to define the “event” of interest. To change this, use the lev option to the function there must be columns in the data for each of the class probabilities (named the same as the outcome’s class levels) A similar function can be used to get the analugous precision-recall values and the area under the precision-recall curve: This function requires that the MLmetrics package is installed. For multi-class problems, there are additional functions that can be used to calculate performance. One, mnLogLoss computes the negative of the multinomial log-likelihood (smaller is better) based on the class probabilities. This can be used to optimize tuning parameters but can lead to results that are inconsistent with other measures (e.g. accuracy or the area under the ROC curve), especially when the other measures are near their best possible values. The function has similar arguments to the other functions described above. Here is the two-class data from above: Additionally, the function multiClassSummary computes a number of relevant metrics: the overall accuracy and Kappa statistics using the predicted classes the negative of the multinomial log loss (if class probabilities are available) averages of the “one versus all” statistics such as sensitivity, specificity, the area under the ROC curve, etc.
