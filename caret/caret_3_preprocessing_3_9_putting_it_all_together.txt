 3.9 Putting It All Together In Applied Predictive Modeling there is a case study where the execution times of jobs in a high performance computing environment are being predicted. The data are: The data are a mix of categorical and numeric predictors. Suppose we want to use the Yeo-Johnson transformation on the continuous predictors then center and scale them. Let’s also suppose that we will be running a tree-based models so we might want to keep the factors as factors (as opposed to creating dummy variables). We run the function on all the columns except the last, which is the outcome. The two predictors labeled as “ignored” in the output are the two factor predictors. These are not altered but the numeric predictors are transformed. However, the predictor for the number of pending jobs, has a very sparse and unbalanced distribution: For some other models, this might be an issue (especially if we resample or down-sample the data). We can add a filter to check for zero- or near zero-variance predictors prior to running the pre-processing calculations: Note that one predictor is labeled as “removed” and the processed data lack the sparse predictor.
