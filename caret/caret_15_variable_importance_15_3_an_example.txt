15 Variable Importance
variable-importance.html
 15.3 An Example On the model training web, several models were fit to the example data. The boosted tree model has a built-in variable importance score but neither the support vector machine or the regularized discriminant analysis model do. The function automatically scales the importance scores to be between 0 and 100. Using scale  FALSE avoids this normalization step. To get the area under the ROC curve for each predictor, the filterVarImp function can be used. The area under the ROC curve is computed for each class. Alternatively, for models where no built-in importance score is implemented (or exists), the varImp can still be used to get scores. For SVM classification models, the default behavior is to compute the area under the ROC curve. For importance scores generated from varImp.train , a plot method can be used to visualize the results. In the plot below, the top option is used to make the image more readable.
