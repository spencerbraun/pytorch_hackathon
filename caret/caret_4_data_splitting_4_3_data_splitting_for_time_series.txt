 4.3 Data Splitting for Time Series Simple random sampling of time series is probably not the best way to resample times series data. Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2013) discuss rolling forecasting origin techniques that move the training and test sets in time. caret contains a function called createTimeSlices that can create the indices for this type of splitting. The three parameters for this type of splitting are: initialWindow : the initial number of consecutive values in each training set sample horizon : The number of consecutive values in test set sample fixedWindow : A logical: if FALSE , the training set always start at the first sample and the training set size will vary over data splits. As an example, suppose we have a time series with 20 data points. We can fix initialWindow  5 and look at different settings of the other two arguments. In the plot below, rows in each panel correspond to different data splits (i.e.Â resamples) and the columns correspond to different data points. Also, red indicates samples that are in included in the training set and the blue indicates samples in the test set.
