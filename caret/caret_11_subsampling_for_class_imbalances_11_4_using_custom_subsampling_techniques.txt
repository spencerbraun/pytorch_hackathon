 11.4 Using Custom Subsampling Techniques Users have the ability to create their own type of subsampling procedure. To do this, alternative syntax is used with the sampling argument of the trainControl . Previously, we used a simple string as the value of this argument. Another way to specify the argument is to use a list with three (named) elements: The name value is a character string used when the train object is printed. It can be any string. The func element is a function that does the subsampling. It should have arguments called x and y that will contain the predictors and outcome data, respectively. The function should return a list with elements of the same name. The first element is a single logical value that indicates whether the subsampling should occur first relative to pre-process. A value of FALSE means that the subsampling function will receive the sampled versions of x and y . For example, here is what the list version of the sampling argument looks like when simple down-sampling is used: As another example, suppose we want to use SMOTE but use 10 nearest neighbors instead of the default of 5. To do this, we can create a simple wrapper around the SMOTE function and call this instead: The control object would then be:
