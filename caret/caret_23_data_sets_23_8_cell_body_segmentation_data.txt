 23.8 Cell Body Segmentation Data Hill, LaPan, Li and Haney (2007) develop models to predict which cells in a high content screen were well segmented. The data consists of 119 imaging measurements on 2019. The original analysis used 1009 for training and 1010 as a test set (see the column called Case ). The outcome class is contained in a factor variable called Class with levels PS for poorly segmented and WS for well segmented.
