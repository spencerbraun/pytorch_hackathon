12 Using Recipes with train

 12.1 Why Should you learn this? Here are two reasons: 12.1.1 More versatile tools for preprocessing data caret ’s preprocessing tools have a lot of options but the list is not exhaustive and they will only be called in a specific order. If you would like a broader set of options, the ability to write your own preprocessing tools, or to call them in the order that you desire then you can use a recipe to do that. 12.1.2 Using additional data to measure performance In most modeling functions, including train , most variables are consigned to be either predictors or outcomes. For recipes, there are more options. For example, you might want to have specific columns of your data set be available when you compute how well the model is performing, such as: if different stratification variables (e.g. patients, ZIP codes, etc) are required to do correct summaries or ancillary data might be need to compute the expected profit or loss based on the model results. To get these data properly, they need to be made available and handled the same way as all of the other data. This means they should be sub- or resampled as all of the other data. Recipes let you do that.
