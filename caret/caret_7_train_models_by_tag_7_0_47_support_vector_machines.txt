 7.0.47 Support Vector Machines (back to contents ) L2 Regularized Linear Support Vector Machines with Class Weights Type: Classification Tuning parameters: cost (Cost) Loss (Loss Function) weight (Class Weight) Required packages: LiblineaR L2 Regularized Support Vector Machine (dual) with Linear Kernel Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: cost (Cost) Loss (Loss Function) Required packages: LiblineaR Least Squares Support Vector Machine Type: Classification Tuning parameters: tau (Regularization Parameter) Required packages: kernlab Least Squares Support Vector Machine with Polynomial Kernel Type: Classification Tuning parameters: degree (Polynomial Degree) scale (Scale) tau (Regularization Parameter) Required packages: kernlab Least Squares Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function Kernel Type: Classification Tuning parameters: sigma (Sigma) tau (Regularization Parameter) Required packages: kernlab Linear Support Vector Machines with Class Weights Type: Classification Tuning parameters: cost (Cost) weight (Class Weight) Required packages: e1071 Support Vector Machines with Boundrange String Kernel Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: length (length) C (Cost) Required packages: kernlab Support Vector Machines with Class Weights Type: Classification Tuning parameters: sigma (Sigma) C (Cost) Weight (Weight) Required packages: kernlab Support Vector Machines with Exponential String Kernel Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: lambda (lambda) C (Cost) Required packages: kernlab Support Vector Machines with Linear Kernel Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: C (Cost) Required packages: kernlab Support Vector Machines with Linear Kernel Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: cost (Cost) Required packages: e1071 Support Vector Machines with Polynomial Kernel Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: degree (Polynomial Degree) scale (Scale) C (Cost) Required packages: kernlab Support Vector Machines with Radial Basis Function Kernel Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: sigma (Sigma) C (Cost) Required packages: kernlab Support Vector Machines with Radial Basis Function Kernel Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: C (Cost) Required packages: kernlab Support Vector Machines with Radial Basis Function Kernel Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: sigma (Sigma) C (Cost) Required packages: kernlab Notes: This SVM model tunes over the cost parameter and the RBF kernel parameter sigma. In the latter case, using tuneLength will, at most, evaluate six values of the kernel parameter. This enables a broad search over the cost parameter and a relatively narrow search over sigma Support Vector Machines with Spectrum String Kernel Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: length (length) C (Cost) Required packages: kernlab
