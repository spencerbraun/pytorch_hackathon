 20.3 Recursive Feature Elimination via caret In caret , Algorithm 1 is implemented by the function rfeIter . The resampling-based Algorithm 2 is in the rfe function. Given the potential selection bias issues, this document focuses on rfe . There are several arguments: x , a matrix or data frame of predictor variables y , a vector (numeric or factor) of outcomes sizes , a integer vector for the specific subset sizes that should be tested (which need not to include ncol(x) ) rfeControl , a list of options that can be used to specify the model and the methods for prediction, ranking etc. For a specific model, a set of functions must be specified in rfeControl$functions . Sections below has descriptions of these sub-functions. There are a number of pre-defined sets of functions for several models, including: linear regression (in the object lmFuncs ), random forests ( rfFuncs ), naive Bayes ( nbFuncs ), bagged trees ( treebagFuncs ) and functions that can be used with caret â€™s train function ( caretFuncs ). The latter is useful if the model has tuning parameters that must be determined at each iteration.
