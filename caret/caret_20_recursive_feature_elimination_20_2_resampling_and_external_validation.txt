20 Recursive Feature Elimination

 20.2 Resampling and External Validation Since feature selection is part of the model building process, resampling methods (e.g. cross-validation, the bootstrap) should factor in the variability caused by feature selection when calculating performance. For example, the RFE procedure in Algorithm 1 can estimate the model performance on line 1.7, which during the selection process. Ambroise and McLachlan (2002) and Svetnik et al (2004) showed that improper use of resampling to measure performance will result in models that perform poorly on new samples. To get performance estimates that incorporate the variation due to feature selection, it is suggested that the steps in Algorithm 1 be encapsulated inside an outer layer of resampling (e.g. 10-fold cross-validation). Algorithm 2 shows a version of the algorithm that uses resampling. While this will provide better estimates of performance, it is more computationally burdensome. For users with access to machines with multiple processors, the first For loop in Algorithm 2 (line 2.1) can be easily parallelized. Another complication to using resampling is that multiple lists of the “best” predictors are generated at each iteration. At first this may seem like a disadvantage, but it does provide a more probabilistic assessment of predictor importance than a ranking based on a single fixed data set. At the end of the algorithm, a consensus ranking can be used to determine the best predictors to retain.
