 13.9 Illustrative Example 6: Offsets in Generalized Linear Models Like the mboost example above , a custom method is required since a formula element is used to set the offset variable. Here is an example from ?glm : We can write a small custom method to duplicate this model. Two details of note: If we have factors in the data and do not want train to convert them to dummy variables, the formula method for train should be avoided. We can let glm do that inside the custom method. This would help glm understand that the dummy variable columns came from the same original factor. This will avoid errors in other functions used with glm (e.g. anova ). The slot for x should include any variables that are on the right-hand side of the model formula, including the offset column. Here is the custom model:
