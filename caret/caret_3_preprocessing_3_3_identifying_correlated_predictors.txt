 3.3 Identifying Correlated Predictors While there are some models that thrive on correlated predictors (such as pls ), other models may benefit from reducing the level of correlation between the predictors. Given a correlation matrix, the findCorrelation function uses the following algorithm to flag predictors for removal: For the previous MDRR data, there are 65 descriptors that are almost perfectly correlated (|correlation| > 0.999), such as the total information index of atomic composition ( IAC ) and the total information content index (neighborhood symmetry of 0-order) ( TIC0 ) (correlation  1). The code chunk below shows the effect of removing descriptors with absolute correlations above 0.75.
