 7.0.16 Handle Missing Predictor Data (back to contents ) AdaBoost.M1 Type: Classification Tuning parameters: mfinal (#Trees) maxdepth (Max Tree Depth) coeflearn (Coefficient Type) Required packages: adabag , plyr A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Bagged AdaBoost Type: Classification Tuning parameters: mfinal (#Trees) maxdepth (Max Tree Depth) Required packages: adabag , plyr A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Boosted Classification Trees Type: Classification Tuning parameters: iter (#Trees) maxdepth (Max Tree Depth) nu (Learning Rate) Required packages: ada , plyr C5.0 Type: Classification Tuning parameters: trials (# Boosting Iterations) model (Model Type) winnow (Winnow) Required packages: C50 , plyr A model-specific variable importance metric is available. CART Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: cp (Complexity Parameter) Required packages: rpart A model-specific variable importance metric is available. CART Type: Regression, Classification No tuning parameters for this model Required packages: rpart A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Notes: This CART model replicates the same process used by the rpart function where the model complexity is determined using the one-standard error method. This procedure is replicated inside of the resampling done by train so that an external resampling estimate can be obtained. CART Type: Regression, Classification Tuning parameters: maxdepth (Max Tree Depth) Required packages: rpart A model-specific variable importance metric is available. CART or Ordinal Responses Type: Classification Tuning parameters: cp (Complexity Parameter) split (Split Function) prune (Pruning Measure) Required packages: rpartScore , plyr A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Cost-Sensitive C5.0 Type: Classification Tuning parameters: trials (# Boosting Iterations) model (Model Type) winnow (Winnow) cost (Cost) Required packages: C50 , plyr A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Cost-Sensitive CART Type: Classification Tuning parameters: cp (Complexity Parameter) Cost (Cost) Required packages: rpart , plyr Single C5.0 Ruleset Type: Classification No tuning parameters for this model Required packages: C50 A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Single C5.0 Tree Type: Classification No tuning parameters for this model Required packages: C50 A model-specific variable importance metric is available.
