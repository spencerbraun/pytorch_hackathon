5 Model Training and Tuning

 5.1 Model Training and Parameter Tuning The caret package has several functions that attempt to streamline the model building and evaluation process. The train function can be used to evaluate, using resampling, the effect of model tuning parameters on performance choose the “optimal” model across these parameters estimate model performance from a training set First, a specific model must be chosen. Currently, 238 are available using caret ; see train Model List or train Models By Tag for details. On these pages, there are lists of tuning parameters that can potentially be optimized. User-defined models can also be created. The first step in tuning the model (line 1 in the algorithm below) is to choose a set of parameters to evaluate. For example, if fitting a Partial Least Squares (PLS) model, the number of PLS components to evaluate must be specified. Once the model and tuning parameter values have been defined, the type of resampling should be also be specified. Currently, k -fold cross-validation (once or repeated), leave-one-out cross-validation and bootstrap (simple estimation or the 632 rule) resampling methods can be used by train . After resampling, the process produces a profile of performance measures is available to guide the user as to which tuning parameter values should be chosen. By default, the function automatically chooses the tuning parameters associated with the best value, although different algorithms can be used (see details below).
