 4.2 Splitting Based on the Predictors Also, the function maxDissim can be used to create sub–samples using a maximum dissimilarity approach ( Willett, 1999 ). Suppose there is a data set A with m samples and a larger data set B with n samples. We may want to create a sub–sample from B that is diverse when compared to A . To do this, for each sample in B , the function calculates the m dissimilarities between each point in A . The most dissimilar point in B is added to A and the process continues. There are many methods in R to calculate dissimilarity. caret uses the proxy package. See the manual for that package for a list of available measures. Also, there are many ways to calculate which sample is “most dissimilar”. The argument obj can be used to specify any function that returns a scalar measure. caret includes two functions, minDiss and sumDiss , that can be used to maximize the minimum and total dissimilarities, respectfully. As an example, the figure below shows a scatter plot of two chemical descriptors for the Cox2 data. Using an initial random sample of 5 compounds, we can select 20 more compounds from the data so that the new compounds are most dissimilar from the initial 5 that were specified. The panels in the figure show the results using several combinations of distance metrics and scoring functions. For these data, the distance measure has less of an impact than the scoring method for determining which compounds are most dissimilar. The visualization below shows the data set (small points), the starting samples (larger blue points) and the order in which the other 20 samples are added.
