 7.0.3 Bayesian Model (back to contents ) Bayesian Additive Regression Trees Type: Classification, Regression Tuning parameters: num_trees (#Trees) k (Prior Boundary) alpha (Base Terminal Node Hyperparameter) beta (Power Terminal Node Hyperparameter) nu (Degrees of Freedom) Required packages: bartMachine A model-specific variable importance metric is available. Bayesian Generalized Linear Model Type: Regression, Classification No tuning parameters for this model Required packages: arm Bayesian Regularized Neural Networks Type: Regression Tuning parameters: neurons (# Neurons) Required packages: brnn Bayesian Ridge Regression Type: Regression No tuning parameters for this model Required packages: monomvn Bayesian Ridge Regression (Model Averaged) Type: Regression No tuning parameters for this model Required packages: monomvn Notes: This model makes predictions by averaging the predictions based on the posterior estimates of the regression coefficients. While it is possible that some of these posterior estimates are zero for non-informative predictors, the final predicted value may be a function of many (or even all) predictors. Model Averaged Naive Bayes Classifier Type: Classification Tuning parameters: smooth (Smoothing Parameter) prior (Prior Probability) Required packages: bnclassify Naive Bayes Type: Classification Tuning parameters: laplace (Laplace Correction) usekernel (Distribution Type) adjust (Bandwidth Adjustment) Required packages: naivebayes Naive Bayes Type: Classification Tuning parameters: fL (Laplace Correction) usekernel (Distribution Type) adjust (Bandwidth Adjustment) Required packages: klaR Naive Bayes Classifier Type: Classification Tuning parameters: smooth (Smoothing Parameter) Required packages: bnclassify Naive Bayes Classifier with Attribute Weighting Type: Classification Tuning parameters: smooth (Smoothing Parameter) Required packages: bnclassify Semi-Naive Structure Learner Wrapper Type: Classification Tuning parameters: k (#Folds) epsilon (Minimum Absolute Improvement) smooth (Smoothing Parameter) final_smooth (Final Smoothing Parameter) direction (Search Direction) Required packages: bnclassify Spike and Slab Regression Type: Regression Tuning parameters: vars (Variables Retained) Required packages: spikeslab , plyr Notes: Unlike other packages used by train , the spikeslab package is fully loaded when this model is used. The Bayesian lasso Type: Regression Tuning parameters: sparsity (Sparsity Threshold) Required packages: monomvn Notes: This model creates predictions using the mean of the posterior distributions but sets some parameters specifically to zero based on the tuning parameter sparsity . For example, when sparsity  .5 , only coefficients where at least half the posterior estimates are nonzero are used. Tree Augmented Naive Bayes Classifier Type: Classification Tuning parameters: score (Score Function) smooth (Smoothing Parameter) Required packages: bnclassify Tree Augmented Naive Bayes Classifier Structure Learner Wrapper Type: Classification Tuning parameters: k (#Folds) epsilon (Minimum Absolute Improvement) smooth (Smoothing Parameter) final_smooth (Final Smoothing Parameter) sp (Super-Parent) Required packages: bnclassify Tree Augmented Naive Bayes Classifier with Attribute Weighting Type: Classification Tuning parameters: score (Score Function) smooth (Smoothing Parameter) Required packages: bnclassify Variational Bayesian Multinomial Probit Regression Type: Classification Tuning parameters: estimateTheta (Theta Estimated) Required packages: vbmp
