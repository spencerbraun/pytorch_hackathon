       "[('\"sklearn_1_10_decision_trees 1.10. Decision Trees modules/tree.html  1.10.3. Multi-output problems  A multi-output problem is a supervised learning problem with several outputs to predict, that is when Y is a 2d array of size . When there is no correlation between the outputs, a very simple way to solve this kind of problem is to build n independent models, i.e. one for each output, and then to use those models to independently predict each one of the n outputs. However, because it is likely that the output values related to the same input are themselves correlated, an often better way is to build a single model capable of predicting simultaneously all n outputs. First, it requires lower training time since only a single estimator is built. Second, the generalization accuracy of the resulting estimator may often be increased. With regard to decision trees, this strategy can readily be used to support multi-output problems. This requires the following changes: Store n output values in leaves, instead of 1; Use splitting criteria that compute the average reduction across all n outputs. This module offers support for multi-output problems by implementing this strategy in both DecisionTreeClassifier and DecisionTreeRegressor . If a decision tree is fit on an output array Y of size then the resulting estimator will: Output n_output values upon ; Output a list of n_output arrays of class probabilities upon . The use of multi-output trees for regression is demonstrated in Multi-output Decision Tree Regression . In this example, the input X is a single real value and the outputs Y are the sine and cosine of X. The use of multi-output trees for classification is demonstrated in Face completion with a multi-output estimators . In this example, the inputs X are the pixels of the upper half of faces and the outputs Y are the pixels of the lower half of those faces.

       " ('\"sklearn_7_5_loading_other_datasets 7.5. Loading other datasets datasets/index.html#loading-other-datasets  7.4. Generated datasets  In addition, scikit-learn includes various random sample generators that can be used to build artificial datasets of controlled size and complexity. 7.4.1. Generators for classification and clustering  These generators produce a matrix of features and corresponding discrete targets. 7.4.1.1. Single label  Both make_blobs and make_classification create multiclass datasets by allocating each class one or more normally-distributed clusters of points. make_blobs provides greater control regarding the centers and standard deviations of each cluster, and is used to demonstrate clustering. make_classification specialises in introducing noise by way of: correlated, redundant and uninformative features; multiple Gaussian clusters per class; and linear transformations of the feature space. make_gaussian_quantiles divides a single Gaussian cluster into near-equal-size classes separated by concentric hyperspheres. make_hastie_10_2 generates a similar binary, 10-dimensional problem. make_circles and make_moons generate 2d binary classification datasets that are challenging to certain algorithms (e.g. centroid-based clustering or linear classification), including optional Gaussian noise. They are useful for visualisation. make_circles produces Gaussian data with a spherical decision boundary for binary classification, while make_moons produces two interleaving half circles. 7.4.1.2. Multilabel  make_multilabel_classification generates random samples with multiple labels, reflecting a bag of words drawn from a mixture of topics. The number of topics for each document is drawn from a Poisson distribution, and the topics themselves are drawn from a fixed random distribution. Similarly, the number of words is drawn from Poisson, with words drawn from a multinomial, where each topic defines a probability distribution over words. Simplifications with respect to true bag-of-words mixtures include: Per-topic word distributions are independently drawn, where in reality all would be affected by a sparse base distribution, and would be correlated. For a document generated from multiple topics, all topics are weighted equally in generating its bag of words. Documents without labels words at random, rather than from a base distribution. 7.4.1.3. Biclustering  make_biclusters (shape,\\xa0n_clusters,\\xa0*[,\\xa0…]) Generate an array with constant block diagonal structure for biclustering. make_checkerboard (shape,\\xa0n_clusters,\\xa0*[,\\xa0…]) Generate an array with block checkerboard structure for biclustering. 7.4.2. Generators for regression  make_regression produces regression targets as an optionally-sparse random linear combination of random features, with noise. Its informative features may be uncorrelated, or low rank (few features account for most of the variance). Other regression generators generate functions deterministically from randomized features. make_sparse_uncorrelated produces a target as a linear combination of four features with fixed coefficients. Others encode explicitly non-linear relations: make_friedman1 is related by polynomial and sine transforms; make_friedman2 includes feature multiplication and reciprocation; and make_friedman3 is similar with an arctan transformation on the target. 7.4.3. Generators for manifold learning  make_s_curve ([n_samples,\\xa0noise,\\xa0random_state]) Generate an S curve dataset. make_swiss_roll ([n_samples,\\xa0noise,\\xa0random_state]) Generate a swiss roll dataset. 7.4.4. Generators for decomposition  make_low_rank_matrix ([n_samples,\\xa0…]) Generate a mostly low rank matrix with bell-shaped singular values make_sparse_coded_signal (n_samples,\\xa0*,\\xa0…) Generate a signal as a sparse combination of dictionary elements. make_spd_matrix (n_dim,\\xa0*[,\\xa0random_state]) Generate a random symmetric, positive-definite matrix. make_sparse_spd_matrix ([dim,\\xa0alpha,\\xa0…]) Generate a sparse symmetric definite positive matrix. \"\\n',\n",

The Olivetti faces dataset  This dataset contains a set of face images taken between April 1992 and April 1994 at AT&T Laboratories Cambridge. The sklearn.datasets.fetch_olivetti_faces function is the data fetching / caching function that downloads the data archive from AT&T. As described on the original website: There are ten different images of each of 40 distinct subjects. For some subjects, the images were taken at different times, varying the lighting, facial expressions (open / closed eyes, smiling / not smiling) and facial details (glasses / no glasses). All the images were taken against a dark homogeneous background with the subjects in an upright, frontal position (with tolerance for some side movement). Data Set Characteristics: Classes 40 Samples total 400 Dimensionality 4096 Features real, between 0 and 1 The image is quantized to 256 grey levels and stored as unsigned 8-bit integers; the loader will convert these to floating point values on the interval [0, 1], which are easier to work with for many algorithms. The “target” for this database is an integer from 0 to 39 indicating the identity of the person pictured; however, with only 10 examples per class, this relatively small dataset is more interesting from an unsupervised or semi-supervised perspective. The original dataset consisted of 92 x 112, while the version available here consists of 64x64 images. When using these images, please give credit to AT&T Laboratories Cambridge. 7.3.2. The 20 newsgroups text dataset  The 20 newsgroups dataset comprises around 18000 newsgroups posts on 20 topics split in two subsets: one for training (or development) and the other one for testing (or for performance evaluation). The split between the train and test set is based upon a messages posted before and after a specific date. This module contains two loaders. The first one, sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups , returns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature extractors such as sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer with custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors. The second one, sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized , returns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature extractor. Data Set Characteristics: Classes 20 Samples total 18846 Dimensionality 1 Features text 7.3.2.1. Usage  The sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups function is a data fetching / caching functions that downloads the data archive from the original 20 newsgroups website , extracts the archive contents in the folder and calls the sklearn.datasets.load_files on either the training or testing set folder, or both of them: The real data lies in the and attributes. The target attribute is the integer index of the category: It is possible to load only a sub-selection of the categories by passing the list of the categories to load to the sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups function: 7.3.2.2. Converting text to vectors  In order to feed predictive or clustering models with the text data, one first need to turn the text into vectors of numerical values suitable for statistical analysis. This can be achieved with the utilities of the as demonstrated in the following example that extract TF-IDF vectors of unigram tokens from a subset of 20news: The extracted TF-IDF vectors are very sparse, with an average of 159 non-zero components by sample in a more than 30000-dimensional space (less than .5% non-zero features): sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized is a function which returns ready-to-use token counts features instead of file names. 7.3.2.3. Filtering text for more realistic training  It is easy for a classifier to overfit on particular things that appear in the 20 Newsgroups data, such as newsgroup headers. Many classifiers achieve very high F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that aren’t from this window of time. For example, let’s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, which is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score: (The example Classification of text documents using sparse features shuffles the training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case multinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious yet of what’s going on inside this classifier?) Let’s take a look at what the most informative features are: You can now see many things that these features have overfit to: Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as and appear more or less often. Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature. The word “article” is a significant feature, based on how often people quote previous posts like this: “In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]> wrote:” Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who were posting at the time. With such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers barely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the same high level. For this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a parameter called remove , telling it what kinds of information to strip out of each file. remove should be a tuple containing any subset of , telling it to remove headers, signature blocks, and quotation blocks respectively. This classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed metadata that has little to do with topic classification. It loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data: Some other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try running Sample pipeline for text feature extraction and evaluation with and without the option to compare the results. Recommendation When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this by setting . The F-score will be lower because it is more realistic. Examples Sample pipeline for text feature extraction and evaluation Classification of text documents using sparse features 7.3.3. The Labeled Faces in the Wild face recognition dataset  This dataset is a collection of JPEG pictures of famous people collected over the internet, all details are available on the official website: http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/ Each picture is centered on a single face. The typical task is called Face Verification: given a pair of two pictures, a binary classifier must predict whether the two images are from the same person. An alternative task, Face Recognition or Face Identification is: given the picture of the face of an unknown person, identify the name of the person by referring to a gallery of previously seen pictures of identified persons. Both Face Verification and Face Recognition are tasks that are typically performed on the output of a model trained to perform Face Detection. The most popular model for Face Detection is called Viola-Jones and is implemented in the OpenCV library. The LFW faces were extracted by this face detector from various online websites. Data Set Characteristics: Classes 5749 Samples total 13233 Dimensionality 5828 Features real, between 0 and 255 7.3.3.1. Usage  provides two loaders that will automatically download, cache, parse the metadata files, decode the jpeg and convert the interesting slices into memmapped numpy arrays. This dataset size is more than 200 MB. The first load typically takes more than a couple of minutes to fully decode the relevant part of the JPEG files into numpy arrays. If the dataset has been loaded once, the following times the loading times less than 200ms by using a memmapped version memoized on the disk in the folder using . The first loader is used for the Face Identification task: a multi-class classification task (hence supervised learning): The default slice is a rectangular shape around the face, removing most of the background: Each of the faces is assigned to a single person id in the array: The second loader is typically used for the face verification task: each sample is a pair of two picture belonging or not to the same person: Both for the sklearn.datasets.fetch_lfw_people and sklearn.datasets.fetch_lfw_pairs function it is possible to get an additional dimension with the RGB color channels by passing , in that case the shape will be . The sklearn.datasets.fetch_lfw_pairs datasets is subdivided into 3 subsets: the development set, the development set and an evaluation set meant to compute performance metrics using a 10-folds cross validation scheme.

Kddcup 99 dataset  The KDD Cup ‘99 dataset was created by processing the tcpdump portions of the 1998 DARPA Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Evaluation dataset, created by MIT Lincoln Lab [1]. The artificial data (described on the dataset’s homepage ) was generated using a closed network and hand-injected attacks to produce a large number of different types of attack with normal activity in the background. As the initial goal was to produce a large training set for supervised learning algorithms, there is a large proportion (80.1%) of abnormal data which is unrealistic in real world, and inappropriate for unsupervised anomaly detection which aims at detecting ‘abnormal’ data, ie qualitatively different from normal data in large minority among the observations. We thus transform the KDD Data set into two different data sets: SA and SF. -SA is obtained by simply selecting all the normal data, and a small proportion of abnormal data to gives an anomaly proportion of 1%. -SF is obtained as in [2] by simply picking up the data whose attribute logged_in is positive, thus focusing on the intrusion attack, which gives a proportion of 0.3% of attack. -http and smtp are two subsets of SF corresponding with third feature equal to ‘http’ (resp. to ‘smtp’) General KDD structure : Samples total 4898431 Dimensionality 41 Features discrete (int) or continuous (float) Targets str, ‘normal.’ or name of the anomaly type SA structure : Samples total 976158 Dimensionality 41 Features discrete (int) or continuous (float) Targets str, ‘normal.’ or name of the anomaly type SF structure : Samples total 699691 Dimensionality 4 Features discrete (int) or continuous (float) Targets str, ‘normal.’ or name of the anomaly type http structure : Samples total 619052 Dimensionality 3 Features discrete (int) or continuous (float) Targets str, ‘normal.’ or name of the anomaly type smtp structure : Samples total 95373 Dimensionality 3 Features discrete (int) or continuous (float) Targets str, ‘normal.’ or name of the anomaly type sklearn.datasets.fetch_kddcup99 will load the kddcup99 dataset; it returns a dictionary-like object with the feature matrix in the member and the target values in .

       " ('\"sklearn_8_2_computational_performance 8.2. Computational Performance modules/computing.html#computational-performance  8.2. Computational Performance  For some applications the performance (mainly latency and throughput at prediction time) of estimators is crucial. It may also be of interest to consider the training throughput but this is often less important in a production setup (where it often takes place offline). We will review here the orders of magnitude you can expect from a number of scikit-learn estimators in different contexts and provide some tips and tricks for overcoming performance bottlenecks. Prediction latency is measured as the elapsed time necessary to make a prediction (e.g. in micro-seconds). Latency is often viewed as a distribution and operations engineers often focus on the latency at a given percentile of this distribution (e.g. the 90 percentile). Prediction throughput is defined as the number of predictions the software can deliver in a given amount of time (e.g. in predictions per second). An important aspect of performance optimization is also that it can hurt prediction accuracy. Indeed, simpler models (e.g. linear instead of non-linear, or with fewer parameters) often run faster but are not always able to take into account the same exact properties of the data as more complex ones. 8.2.1. Prediction Latency  One of the most straight-forward concerns one may have when using/choosing a machine learning toolkit is the latency at which predictions can be made in a production environment. The main factors that influence the prediction latency are Number of features Input data representation and sparsity Model complexity Feature extraction A last major parameter is also the possibility to do predictions in bulk or one-at-a-time mode. 8.2.1.1. Bulk versus Atomic mode  In general doing predictions in bulk (many instances at the same time) is more efficient for a number of reasons (branching predictability, CPU cache, linear algebra libraries optimizations etc.). Here we see on a setting with few features that independently of estimator choice the bulk mode is always faster, and for some of them by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude: To benchmark different estimators for your case you can simply change the parameter in this example: Prediction Latency . This should give you an estimate of the order of magnitude of the prediction latency. 8.2.1.2. Configuring Scikit-learn for reduced validation overhead  Scikit-learn does some validation on data that increases the overhead per call to and similar functions. In particular, checking that features are finite (not NaN or infinite) involves a full pass over the data. If you ensure that your data is acceptable, you may suppress checking for finiteness by setting the environment variable to a non-empty string before importing scikit-learn, or configure it in Python with sklearn.set_config . For more control than these global settings, a config_context allows you to set this configuration within a specified context: Note that this will affect all uses of sklearn.utils.assert_all_finite within the context. 8.2.1.3. Influence of the Number of Features  Obviously when the number of features increases so does the memory consumption of each example. Indeed, for a matrix of instances with features, the space complexity is in . From a computing perspective it also means that the number of basic operations (e.g., multiplications for vector-matrix products in linear models) increases too. Here is a graph of the evolution of the prediction latency with the number of features: Overall you can expect the prediction time to increase at least linearly with the number of features (non-linear cases can happen depending on the global memory footprint and estimator). 8.2.1.4. Influence of the Input Data Representation  Scipy provides sparse matrix data structures which are optimized for storing sparse data. The main feature of sparse formats is that you don’t store zeros so if your data is sparse then you use much less memory. A non-zero value in a sparse ( CSR or CSC ) representation will only take on average one 32bit integer position + the 64 bit floating point value + an additional 32bit per row or column in the matrix. Using sparse input on a dense (or sparse) linear model can speedup prediction by quite a bit as only the non zero valued features impact the dot product and thus the model predictions. Hence if you have 100 non zeros in 1e6 dimensional space, you only need 100 multiply and add operation instead of 1e6. Calculation over a dense representation, however, may leverage highly optimised vector operations and multithreading in BLAS, and tends to result in fewer CPU cache misses. So the sparsity should typically be quite high (10% non-zeros max, to be checked depending on the hardware) for the sparse input representation to be faster than the dense input representation on a machine with many CPUs and an optimized BLAS implementation. Here is sample code to test the sparsity of your input: As a rule of thumb you can consider that if the sparsity ratio is greater than 90% you can probably benefit from sparse formats. Check Scipy’s sparse matrix formats documentation for more information on how to build (or convert your data to) sparse matrix formats. Most of the time the and formats work best. 8.2.1.5. Influence of the Model Complexity  Generally speaking, when model complexity increases, predictive power and latency are supposed to increase. Increasing predictive power is usually interesting, but for many applications we would better not increase prediction latency too much. We will now review this idea for different families of supervised models. For sklearn.linear_model (e.g. Lasso, ElasticNet, SGDClassifier/Regressor, Ridge & RidgeClassifier, PassiveAggressiveClassifier/Regressor, LinearSVC, LogisticRegression…) the decision function that is applied at prediction time is the same (a dot product) , so latency should be equivalent. Here is an example using sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier with the penalty. The regularization strength is globally controlled by the parameter. With a sufficiently high , one can then increase the parameter of to enforce various levels of sparsity in the model coefficients. Higher sparsity here is interpreted as less model complexity as we need fewer coefficients to describe it fully. Of course sparsity influences in turn the prediction time as the sparse dot-product takes time roughly proportional to the number of non-zero coefficients. For the sklearn.svm family of algorithms with a non-linear kernel, the latency is tied to the number of support vectors (the fewer the faster). Latency and throughput should (asymptotically) grow linearly with the number of support vectors in a SVC or SVR model. The kernel will also influence the latency as it is used to compute the projection of the input vector once per support vector. In the following graph the parameter of sklearn.svm.NuSVR was used to influence the number of support vectors. For sklearn.ensemble of trees (e.g. RandomForest, GBT, ExtraTrees etc) the number of trees and their depth play the most important role. Latency and throughput should scale linearly with the number of trees. In this case we used directly the parameter of sklearn.ensemble.gradient_boosting.GradientBoostingRegressor . In any case be warned that decreasing model complexity can hurt accuracy as mentioned above. For instance a non-linearly separable problem can be handled with a speedy linear model but prediction power will very likely suffer in the process. 8.2.1.6. Feature Extraction Latency  Most scikit-learn models are usually pretty fast as they are implemented either with compiled Cython extensions or optimized computing libraries. On the other hand, in many real world applications the feature extraction process (i.e. turning raw data like database rows or network packets into numpy arrays) governs the overall prediction time. For example on the Reuters text classification task the whole preparation (reading and parsing SGML files, tokenizing the text and hashing it into a common vector space) is taking 100 to 500 times more time than the actual prediction code, depending on the chosen model. In many cases it is thus recommended to carefully time and profile your feature extraction code as it may be a good place to start optimizing when your overall latency is too slow for your application. 8.2.2. Prediction Throughput  Another important metric to care about when sizing production systems is the throughput i.e. the number of predictions you can make in a given amount of time. Here is a benchmark from the Prediction Latency example that measures this quantity for a number of estimators on synthetic data: These throughputs are achieved on a single process. An obvious way to increase the throughput of your application is to spawn additional instances (usually processes in Python because of the GIL ) that share the same model. One might also add machines to spread the load. A detailed explanation on how to achieve this is beyond the scope of this documentation though. 8.2.3. Tips and Tricks  8.2.3.1. Linear algebra libraries  As scikit-learn relies heavily on Numpy/Scipy and linear algebra in general it makes sense to take explicit care of the versions of these libraries. Basically, you ought to make sure that Numpy is built using an optimized BLAS / LAPACK library. Not all models benefit from optimized BLAS and Lapack implementations. For instance models based on (randomized) decision trees typically do not rely on BLAS calls in their inner loops, nor do kernel SVMs ( , , , ). On the other hand a linear model implemented with a BLAS DGEMM call (via ) will typically benefit hugely from a tuned BLAS implementation and lead to orders of magnitude speedup over a non-optimized BLAS. You can display the BLAS / LAPACK implementation used by your NumPy / SciPy / scikit-learn install with the following commands: Optimized BLAS / LAPACK implementations include: Atlas (need hardware specific tuning by rebuilding on the target machine) OpenBLAS MKL Apple Accelerate and vecLib frameworks (OSX only) More information can be found on the Scipy install page and in this blog post from Daniel Nouri which has some nice step by step install instructions for Debian / Ubuntu. 8.2.3.2. Limiting Working Memory  Some calculations when implemented using standard numpy vectorized operations involve using a large amount of temporary memory. This may potentially exhaust system memory. Where computations can be performed in fixed-memory chunks, we attempt to do so, and allow the user to hint at the maximum size of this working memory (defaulting to 1GB) using sklearn.set_config or config_context . The following suggests to limit temporary working memory to 128 MiB: An example of a chunked operation adhering to this setting is metric.pairwise_distances_chunked , which facilitates computing row-wise reductions of a pairwise distance matrix. 8.2.3.3. Model Compression  Model compression in scikit-learn only concerns linear models for the moment. In this context it means that we want to control the model sparsity (i.e. the number of non-zero coordinates in the model vectors). It is generally a good idea to combine model sparsity with sparse input data representation. Here is sample code that illustrates the use of the method: In this example we prefer the penalty as it is often a good compromise between model compactness and prediction power. One can also further tune the parameter (in combination with the regularization strength ) to control this tradeoff. A typical benchmark on synthetic data yields a >30% decrease in latency when both the model and input are sparse (with 0.000024 and 0.027400 non-zero coefficients ratio respectively). Your mileage may vary depending on the sparsity and size of your data and model. Furthermore, sparsifying can be very useful to reduce the memory usage of predictive models deployed on production servers. 8.2.3.4. Model Reshaping  Model reshaping consists in selecting only a portion of the available features to fit a model. In other words, if a model discards features during the learning phase we can then strip those from the input. This has several benefits. Firstly it reduces memory (and therefore time) overhead of the model itself. It also allows to discard explicit feature selection components in a pipeline once we know which features to keep from a previous run. Finally, it can help reduce processing time and I/O usage upstream in the data access and feature extraction layers by not collecting and building features that are discarded by the model. For instance if the raw data come from a database, it can make it possible to write simpler and faster queries or reduce I/O usage by making the queries return lighter records. At the moment, reshaping needs to be performed manually in scikit-learn. In the case of sparse input (particularly in format), it is generally sufficient to not generate the relevant features, leaving their columns empty. 8.2.3.5.
