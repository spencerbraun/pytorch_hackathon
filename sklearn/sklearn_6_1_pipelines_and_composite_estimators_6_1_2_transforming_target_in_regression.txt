 6.1.2. Transforming target in regression  TransformedTargetRegressor transforms the targets before fitting a regression model. The predictions are mapped back to the original space via an inverse transform. It takes as an argument the regressor that will be used for prediction, and the transformer that will be applied to the target variable: For simple transformations, instead of a Transformer object, a pair of functions can be passed, defining the transformation and its inverse mapping: Subsequently, the object is created as: By default, the provided functions are checked at each fit to be the inverse of each other. However, it is possible to bypass this checking by setting to : Note The transformation can be triggered by setting either or the pair of functions and . However, setting both options will raise an error. Examples: Effect of transforming the targets in regression model
