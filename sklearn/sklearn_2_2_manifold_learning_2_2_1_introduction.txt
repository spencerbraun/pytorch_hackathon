 2.2.1. Introduction  High-dimensional datasets can be very difficult to visualize. While data in two or three dimensions can be plotted to show the inherent structure of the data, equivalent high-dimensional plots are much less intuitive. To aid visualization of the structure of a dataset, the dimension must be reduced in some way. The simplest way to accomplish this dimensionality reduction is by taking a random projection of the data. Though this allows some degree of visualization of the data structure, the randomness of the choice leaves much to be desired. In a random projection, it is likely that the more interesting structure within the data will be lost. To address this concern, a number of supervised and unsupervised linear dimensionality reduction frameworks have been designed, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and others. These algorithms define specific rubrics to choose an “interesting” linear projection of the data. These methods can be powerful, but often miss important non-linear structure in the data. Manifold Learning can be thought of as an attempt to generalize linear frameworks like PCA to be sensitive to non-linear structure in data. Though supervised variants exist, the typical manifold learning problem is unsupervised: it learns the high-dimensional structure of the data from the data itself, without the use of predetermined classifications. Examples: See Manifold learning on handwritten digits: Locally Linear Embedding, Isomap… for an example of dimensionality reduction on handwritten digits. See Comparison of Manifold Learning methods for an example of dimensionality reduction on a toy “S-curve” dataset. The manifold learning implementations available in scikit-learn are summarized below
