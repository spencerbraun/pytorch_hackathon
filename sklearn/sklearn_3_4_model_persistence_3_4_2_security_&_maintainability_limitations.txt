 3.4.2. Security & maintainability limitations  pickle (and joblib by extension), has some issues regarding maintainability and security. Because of this, Never unpickle untrusted data as it could lead to malicious code being executed upon loading. While models saved using one version of scikit-learn might load in other versions, this is entirely unsupported and inadvisable. It should also be kept in mind that operations performed on such data could give different and unexpected results. In order to rebuild a similar model with future versions of scikit-learn, additional metadata should be saved along the pickled model: The training data, e.g. a reference to an immutable snapshot The python source code used to generate the model The versions of scikit-learn and its dependencies The cross validation score obtained on the training data This should make it possible to check that the cross-validation score is in the same range as before. Since a model internal representation may be different on two different architectures, dumping a model on one architecture and loading it on another architecture is not supported. If you want to know more about these issues and explore other possible serialization methods, please refer to this talk by Alex Gaynor .
