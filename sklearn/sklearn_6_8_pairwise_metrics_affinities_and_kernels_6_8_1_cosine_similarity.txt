 6.8.1. Cosine similarity  cosine_similarity computes the L2-normalized dot product of vectors. That is, if and are row vectors, their cosine similarity is defined as: \[k(x, y)  \frac{x y^\top}{\|x\| \|y\|}\] This is called cosine similarity, because Euclidean (L2) normalization projects the vectors onto the unit sphere, and their dot product is then the cosine of the angle between the points denoted by the vectors. This kernel is a popular choice for computing the similarity of documents represented as tf-idf vectors. cosine_similarity accepts matrices. (Note that the tf-idf functionality in can produce normalized vectors, in which case cosine_similarity is equivalent to linear_kernel , only slower.) References: C.D. Manning, P. Raghavan and H.
