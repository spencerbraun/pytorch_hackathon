 1.12.2. One-Vs-The-Rest  This strategy, also known as one-vs-all , is implemented in OneVsRestClassifier . The strategy consists in fitting one classifier per class. For each classifier, the class is fitted against all the other classes. In addition to its computational efficiency (only classifiers are needed), one advantage of this approach is its interpretability. Since each class is represented by one and only one classifier, it is possible to gain knowledge about the class by inspecting its corresponding classifier. This is the most commonly used strategy and is a fair default choice. 1.12.2.1. Multiclass learning  Below is an example of multiclass learning using OvR: 1.12.2.2. Multilabel learning  OneVsRestClassifier also supports multilabel classification. To use this feature, feed the classifier an indicator matrix, in which cell [i, j] indicates the presence of label j in sample i. Examples: Multilabel classification
