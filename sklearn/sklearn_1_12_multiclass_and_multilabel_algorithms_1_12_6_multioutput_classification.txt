 1.12.6. Multioutput classification  Multioutput classification support can be added to any classifier with MultiOutputClassifier . This strategy consists of fitting one classifier per target. This allows multiple target variable classifications. The purpose of this class is to extend estimators to be able to estimate a series of target functions (f1,f2,f3…,fn) that are trained on a single X predictor matrix to predict a series of responses (y1,y2,y3…,yn). Below is an example of multioutput classification:
