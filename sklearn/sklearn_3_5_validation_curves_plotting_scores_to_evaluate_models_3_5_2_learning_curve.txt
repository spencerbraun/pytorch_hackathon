 3.5.2. Learning curve  A learning curve shows the validation and training score of an estimator for varying numbers of training samples. It is a tool to find out how much we benefit from adding more training data and whether the estimator suffers more from a variance error or a bias error. Consider the following example where we plot the learning curve of a naive Bayes classifier and an SVM. For the naive Bayes, both the validation score and the training score converge to a value that is quite low with increasing size of the training set. Thus, we will probably not benefit much from more training data. In contrast, for small amounts of data, the training score of the SVM is much greater than the validation score. Adding more training samples will most likely increase generalization. We can use the function learning_curve to generate the values that are required to plot such a learning curve (number of samples that have been used, the average scores on the training sets and the average scores on the validation sets):
