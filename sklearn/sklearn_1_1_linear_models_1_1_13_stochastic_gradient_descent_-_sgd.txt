 1.1.13. Stochastic Gradient Descent - SGD  Stochastic gradient descent is a simple yet very efficient approach to fit linear models. It is particularly useful when the number of samples (and the number of features) is very large. The method allows online/out-of-core learning. The classes SGDClassifier and SGDRegressor provide functionality to fit linear models for classification and regression using different (convex) loss functions and different penalties. E.g., with , SGDClassifier fits a logistic regression model, while with it fits a linear support vector machine (SVM). References Stochastic Gradient Descent
