 6.8.3. Polynomial kernel  The function polynomial_kernel computes the degree-d polynomial kernel between two vectors. The polynomial kernel represents the similarity between two vectors. Conceptually, the polynomial kernels considers not only the similarity between vectors under the same dimension, but also across dimensions. When used in machine learning algorithms, this allows to account for feature interaction. The polynomial kernel is defined as: \[k(x, y)  (\gamma x^\top y +c_0)^d\] where: , are the input vectors is the kernel degree If the kernel is said to be homogeneous.
