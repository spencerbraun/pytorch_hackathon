 1.6.5. Nearest Centroid Classifier  The NearestCentroid classifier is a simple algorithm that represents each class by the centroid of its members. In effect, this makes it similar to the label updating phase of the sklearn.cluster.KMeans algorithm. It also has no parameters to choose, making it a good baseline classifier. It does, however, suffer on non-convex classes, as well as when classes have drastically different variances, as equal variance in all dimensions is assumed. See Linear Discriminant Analysis ( sklearn.discriminant_analysis.LinearDiscriminantAnalysis ) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis ( sklearn.discriminant_analysis.QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis ) for more complex methods that do not make this assumption. Usage of the default NearestCentroid is simple: 1.6.5.1. Nearest Shrunken Centroid  The NearestCentroid classifier has a parameter, which implements the nearest shrunken centroid classifier. In effect, the value of each feature for each centroid is divided by the within-class variance of that feature. The feature values are then reduced by . Most notably, if a particular feature value crosses zero, it is set to zero. In effect, this removes the feature from affecting the classification. This is useful, for example, for removing noisy features. In the example below, using a small shrink threshold increases the accuracy of the model from 0.81 to 0.82.
