 1.1.15. Passive Aggressive Algorithms  The passive-aggressive algorithms are a family of algorithms for large-scale learning. They are similar to the Perceptron in that they do not require a learning rate. However, contrary to the Perceptron, they include a regularization parameter . For classification, PassiveAggressiveClassifier can be used with (PA-I) or (PA-II). For regression, PassiveAggressiveRegressor can be used with (PA-I) or (PA-II).
