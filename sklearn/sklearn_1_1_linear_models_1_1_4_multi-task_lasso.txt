 1.1.4. Multi-task Lasso  The MultiTaskLasso is a linear model that estimates sparse coefficients for multiple regression problems jointly: is a 2D array, of shape . The constraint is that the selected features are the same for all the regression problems, also called tasks. The following figure compares the location of the non-zero entries in the coefficient matrix W obtained with a simple Lasso or a MultiTaskLasso. The Lasso estimates yield scattered non-zeros while the non-zeros of the MultiTaskLasso are full columns. Fitting a time-series model, imposing that any active feature be active at all times. Examples: Joint feature selection with multi-task Lasso Mathematically, it consists of a linear model trained with a mixed -norm for regularization. The objective function to minimize is: \[\min_{w} { \frac{1}{2n_{\text{samples}}} ||X W - Y||_{\text{Fro}} ^ 2 + \alpha ||W||_{21}}\] where indicates the Frobenius norm \[||A||_{\text{Fro}}  \sqrt{\sum_{ij} a_{ij}^2}\] and reads \[||A||_{2 1}  \sum_i \sqrt{\sum_j a_{ij}^2}.\] The implementation in the class MultiTaskLasso uses coordinate descent as the algorithm to fit the coefficients.
