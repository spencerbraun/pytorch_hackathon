 1.2.4. Shrinkage  Shrinkage is a form of regularization used to improve the estimation of covariance matrices in situations where the number of training samples is small compared to the number of features. In this scenario, the empirical sample covariance is a poor estimator, and shrinkage helps improving the generalization performance of the classifier. Shrinkage LDA can be used by setting the parameter of the LinearDiscriminantAnalysis class to ‘auto’. This automatically determines the optimal shrinkage parameter in an analytic way following the lemma introduced by Ledoit and Wolf 2 . Note that currently shrinkage only works when setting the parameter to ‘lsqr’ or ‘eigen’. The parameter can also be manually set between 0 and 1. In particular, a value of 0 corresponds to no shrinkage (which means the empirical covariance matrix will be used) and a value of 1 corresponds to complete shrinkage (which means that the diagonal matrix of variances will be used as an estimate for the covariance matrix). Setting this parameter to a value between these two extrema will estimate a shrunk version of the covariance matrix.
