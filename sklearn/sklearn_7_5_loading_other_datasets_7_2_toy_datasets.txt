 7.2. Toy datasets  scikit-learn comes with a few small standard datasets that do not require to download any file from some external website. They can be loaded using the following functions: load_boston (*[, return_X_y]) Load and return the boston house-prices dataset (regression). load_iris (*[, return_X_y, as_frame]) Load and return the iris dataset (classification). load_diabetes (*[, return_X_y, as_frame]) Load and return the diabetes dataset (regression). load_digits (*[, n_class, return_X_y, as_frame]) Load and return the digits dataset (classification). load_linnerud (*[, return_X_y, as_frame]) Load and return the physical excercise linnerud dataset. load_wine (*[, return_X_y, as_frame]) Load and return the wine dataset (classification). load_breast_cancer (*[, return_X_y, as_frame]) Load and return the breast cancer wisconsin dataset (classification). These datasets are useful to quickly illustrate the behavior of the various algorithms implemented in scikit-learn. They are however often too small to be representative of real world machine learning tasks. 7.2.1.

Missing Attribute Values None Class Distribution 33.3% for each of 3 classes. Creator R.A. Fisher Donor Michael Marshall ( MARSHALL%PLU @ io . arc . nasa . gov ) Date July, 1988 The famous Iris database, first used by Sir R.A. Fisher. The dataset is taken from Fisher’s paper. Note that it’s the same as in R, but not as in the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which has two wrong data points. This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher’s paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

Optical recognition of handwritten digits dataset  Data Set Characteristics: Number of Instances 5620 Number of Attributes 64 Attribute Information 8x8 image of integer pixels in the range 0..16. Missing Attribute Values None Creator Alpaydin (alpaydin ‘@’ boun.edu.tr) Date July; 1998 This is a copy of the test set of the UCI ML hand-written digits datasets https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits The data set contains images of hand-written digits: 10 classes where each class refers to a digit. Preprocessing programs made available by NIST were used to extract normalized bitmaps of handwritten digits from a preprinted form. From a total of 43 people, 30 contributed to the training set and different 13 to the test set. 32x32 bitmaps are divided into nonoverlapping blocks of 4x4 and the number of on pixels are counted in each block. This generates an input matrix of 8x8 where each element is an integer in the range 0..16. This reduces dimensionality and gives invariance to small distortions.

Wolberg, W. Nick Street, Olvi L. Mangasarian Donor Nick Street Date November, 1995 This is a copy of UCI ML Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) datasets. https://goo.gl/U2Uwz2 Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. Separating plane described above was obtained using Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, “Decision Tree Construction Via Linear Programming.” Proceedings of the 4th Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society, pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear programming to construct a decision tree. Relevant features were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4 features and 1-3 separating planes. The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane in the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: “Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets”, Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].
