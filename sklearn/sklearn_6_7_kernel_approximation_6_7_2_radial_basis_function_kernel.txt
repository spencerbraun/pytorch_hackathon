 6.7.2. Radial Basis Function Kernel  The RBFSampler constructs an approximate mapping for the radial basis function kernel, also known as Random Kitchen Sinks [RR2007] . This transformation can be used to explicitly model a kernel map, prior to applying a linear algorithm, for example a linear SVM: The mapping relies on a Monte Carlo approximation to the kernel values. The function performs the Monte Carlo sampling, whereas the method performs the mapping of the data. Because of the inherent randomness of the process, results may vary between different calls to the function. The function takes two arguments: , which is the target dimensionality of the feature transform, and , the parameter of the RBF-kernel. A higher will result in a better approximation of the kernel and will yield results more similar to those produced by a kernel SVM. Note that “fitting” the feature function does not actually depend on the data given to the function. Only the dimensionality of the data is used. Details on the method can be found in [RR2007] . For a given value of RBFSampler is often less accurate as Nystroem . RBFSampler is cheaper to compute, though, making use of larger feature spaces more efficient.
