 1.17.6. Complexity  Suppose there are training samples, features, hidden layers, each containing neurons - for simplicity, and output neurons. The time complexity of backpropagation is , where is the number of iterations. Since backpropagation has a high time complexity, it is advisable to start with smaller number of hidden neurons and few hidden layers for training.
