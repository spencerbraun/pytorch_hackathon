 1.12.1. Multilabel classification format  In multilabel learning, the joint set of binary classification tasks is expressed with label binary indicator array: each sample is one row of a 2d array of shape (n_samples, n_classes) with binary values: the one, i.e. the non zero elements, corresponds to the subset of labels. An array such as represents label 0 in the first sample, labels 1 and 2 in the second sample, and no labels in the third sample. Producing multilabel data as a list of sets of labels may be more intuitive. The MultiLabelBinarizer transformer can be used to convert between a collection of collections of labels and the indicator format.
