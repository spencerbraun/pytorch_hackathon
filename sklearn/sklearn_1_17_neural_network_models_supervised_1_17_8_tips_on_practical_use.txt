 1.17.8. Tips on Practical Use  Multi-layer Perceptron is sensitive to feature scaling, so it is highly recommended to scale your data. For example, scale each attribute on the input vector X to [0, 1] or [-1, +1], or standardize it to have mean 0 and variance 1. Note that you must apply the same scaling to the test set for meaningful results. You can use StandardScaler for standardization. An alternative and recommended approach is to use StandardScaler in a Pipeline Finding a reasonable regularization parameter is best done using GridSearchCV , usually in the range . Empirically, we observed that converges faster and with better solutions on small datasets. For relatively large datasets, however, is very robust. It usually converges quickly and gives pretty good performance. with momentum or nesterovâ€™s momentum, on the other hand, can perform better than those two algorithms if learning rate is correctly tuned.
