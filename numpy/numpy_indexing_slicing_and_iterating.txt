 Indexing, Slicing and Iterating  One-dimensional arrays can be indexed, sliced and iterated over, much like lists and other Python sequences. Multidimensional arrays can have one index per axis. These indices are given in a tuple separated by commas: When fewer indices are provided than the number of axes, the missing indices are considered complete slices The expression within brackets in is treated as an followed by as many instances of as needed to represent the remaining axes. NumPy also allows you to write this using dots as . The dots ( ) represent as many colons as needed to produce a complete indexing tuple. For example, if is an array with 5 axes, then is equivalent to , to and to . Iterating over multidimensional arrays is done with respect to the first axis: However, if one wants to perform an operation on each element in the array, one can use the attribute which is an iterator over all the elements of the array: See also Indexing , Indexing (reference), newaxis , ndenumerate , indices Shape Manipulation
