 Indexing with Arrays of Indices  When the indexed array is multidimensional, a single array of indices refers to the first dimension of . The following example shows this behavior by converting an image of labels into a color image using a palette. We can also give indexes for more than one dimension. The arrays of indices for each dimension must have the same shape. In Python, is exactly the same as —so we can put and in a and then do the indexing with that. However, we can not do this by putting and into an array, because this array will be interpreted as indexing the first dimension of a. Another common use of indexing with arrays is the search of the maximum value of time-dependent series: You can also use indexing with arrays as a target to assign to: However, when the list of indices contains repetitions, the assignment is done several times, leaving behind the last value: This is reasonable enough, but watch out if you want to use Python’s construct, as it may not do what you expect: Even though 0 occurs twice in the list of indices, the 0th element is only incremented once. This is because Python requires “a+1” to be equivalent to “a  a + 1”.
