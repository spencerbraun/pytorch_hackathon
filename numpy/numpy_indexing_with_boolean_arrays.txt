 Indexing with Boolean Arrays  When we index arrays with arrays of (integer) indices we are providing the list of indices to pick. With boolean indices the approach is different; we explicitly choose which items in the array we want and which ones we donâ€™t. The most natural way one can think of for boolean indexing is to use boolean arrays that have the same shape as the original array: This property can be very useful in assignments: You can look at the following example to see how to use boolean indexing to generate an image of the Mandelbrot set : The second way of indexing with booleans is more similar to integer indexing; for each dimension of the array we give a 1D boolean array selecting the slices we want: Note that the length of the 1D boolean array must coincide with the length of the dimension (or axis) you want to slice. In the previous example, has length 3 (the number of rows in ), and (of length 4) is suitable to index the 2nd axis (columns) of .
