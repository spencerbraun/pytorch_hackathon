#histograms
 Histograms  The NumPy function applied to an array returns a pair of vectors: the histogram of the array and a vector of the bin edges. Beware: also has a function to build histograms (called , as in Matlab) that differs from the one in NumPy. The main difference is that plots the histogram automatically, while only generates the data.
