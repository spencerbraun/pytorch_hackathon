 Stacking together different arrays  Several arrays can be stacked together along different axes: The function column_stack stacks 1D arrays as columns into a 2D array. It is equivalent to hstack only for 2D arrays: On the other hand, the function row_stack is equivalent to vstack for any input arrays. In fact, row_stack is an alias for vstack : In general, for arrays with more than two dimensions, hstack stacks along their second axes, vstack stacks along their first axes, and concatenate allows for an optional arguments giving the number of the axis along which the concatenation should happen. Note In complex cases, r_ and c_ are useful for creating arrays by stacking numbers along one axis. They allow the use of range literals (“:”) When used with arrays as arguments, r_ and c_ are similar to vstack and hstack in their default behavior, but allow for an optional argument giving the number of the axis along which to concatenate.
